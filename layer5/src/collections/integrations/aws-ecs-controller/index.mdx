<p>
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) will launch, monitor, and scale your application across flexible compute options with automatic integrations to other supporting AWS services that your application needs. 
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
</p>

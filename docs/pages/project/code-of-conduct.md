# Code of Conduct

The Meshery community is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, users, and community members. We follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) to ensure our community remains respectful, collaborative, and productive.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Gracefully accepting** constructive criticism
- **Focusing on what is best** for the community
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories and issues
- Slack channels and discussions

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [maintainers@meshery.io](mailto:maintainers@meshery.io). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

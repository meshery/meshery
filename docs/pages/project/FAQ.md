<h6>Question: What is the difference between <code>make server</code> and <code>mesheryctl system start</code>? Do they both run Meshery on my local machine?</h6>
</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, both of them do run Meshery on your local machine. `make server` builds Meshery from source and runs it on your local OS, while `mesheryctl system start` runs Meshery as a set of containers in Docker or in Kubernetes on your local machine.

<summary><h6>Question: Why is Meshery Server only receiving MeshSync updates from one of my Kubernetes Clusters?</h6></summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In order to receive MeshSync updates, Meshery Server subscribes for updates Meshery Broker. In other words, Meshery Server connects to the `meshery-broker` service port in order to subscribe for streaming MeshSync updates. By default, the Meshery Broker service is deployed as type Kubernetes Service type <code>LoadBalancer</code>, which requires that your Kubernetes cluster provides an external IP address to the Meshery Broker service, exposing it external to the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>If you're running Kubernetes in Docker Desktop, an external IP address of <code>localhost</code> is assigned. If you're running Minikube, and execute <code>minikube tunnel</code> to gain access to Meshery Broker's service, you will find that both Meshery Broker service endpoints (from two different clusters) are sharing the same <code>localhost:4222</code> address and port number. This port sharing causes conflict and Meshery Server is only able to connect to one of the Meshery Brokers.</p>

<p>Few ways to solve this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an external cloud provider which provides you with the LoadBalancer having an external IP address other than localhost.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io">Kind</a> cluster with <a href="https://metallb.universe.tf">MetalLB</a> configuration</li>
</ul>

<h6>Question: Why does the dashboard not show the infrastructure provisioned or discovered by Meshery?</h6></summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> <p>This issue is typically caused by either lack of connectivity between Meshery Server and Meshery Broker or by database corruption. Use the following troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:</p>

<p><strong>Lack of Connectivity</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Confirm that the Meshery Broker service is exposed from your cluster using <code>kubectl get svc -n meshery</code> and that an hostname or IP address is displayed in the External Address column. Meshery Server should be able to reach this address.</li>
<li>It is possible that MeshSync is not healthy and not sending cluster updates, check for MeshSync status by navigating to Settings in Meshery UI and clicking on the MeshSync connection.</li>
<li>If MeshSync is healthy, check the status of Meshery Broker by clicking on the NATS connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>If either is the case, Meshery Operator will make sure MeshSync and Meshery Broker deployments are again healthy, wait for some time, otherwise try redeploying Meshery Operator.</p>

<p><strong>Database Corruption</strong></p>

<p>If MeshSync, Meshery Broker and Meshery Operator are healthy, then perhaps, there is corruption in the Meshery Database. Use the following troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try clearing the database by clicking on the `Flush MeshSync` button associated with the corresponding cluster.</li>
<li>If still `Service Mesh` is not visible in UI, move on to `Hard Reset` of Database. This option is in the <code>Reset System</code> Tab in <code>Settings</code> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You can also verify health of your system using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reference/mesheryctl/system/check">mesheryctl system check</a></p>

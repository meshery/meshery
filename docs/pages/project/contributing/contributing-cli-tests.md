# Contributing to Meshery CLI End-to-End Tests

Meshery CLI is the command line interface for Meshery. Meshery CLI, otherwise known as `mesheryctl`, is a client of Meshery Server's [REST API]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/api). It provides a way to interact with Meshery and perform various operations such as installing, configuring, and managing cloud native infrastructure.

This document is intended to help you contribute to the end-to-end tests for `mesheryctl`, the Meshery CLI. It is designed to be a guide for developers who are new to the project and want to contribute to the testing of `mesheryctl`.

The end-to-end tests for `mesheryctl` are designed to ensure that the CLI is working as expected and that it is compatible with the various cloud native infrastructure and public cloud services that Meshery supports. These tests are run automatically on every pull request to ensure that any changes made to the code do not break the existing functionality of the CLI.

## Familiarizing with Meshery CLI End-to-End Testing

End-to-end testing of `mesheryctl` uses the [Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (BATS) framework to define and execute CLI tests. Each test case is designed to mimic the experience that a Meshery CLI user might have while interacting with `mesheryctl` in their terminal of choice. In this sense, `mesheryctl` tests run end-to-end with each pull request submitted containing changes to either the `/mesheryctl` or the `/server` directories in the `meshery/meshery` repository, ensuring that changes included in those pull requests do not break the existing CLI functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into `mesheryctl`'s testing environment, certain prerequisites must be met to ensure a smooth testing experience. These prerequisites include:

- A working installation of Meshery CLI and Meshery Server.
  - A verified account in your chosen provider which integrate with Meshery.
- A working installation of the BATS testing framework.
  - `bash` as shell terminal.
- [Optional] A working installation of a Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, Kind, etc.) for testing Kubernetes-related functionality.

### Authentication

To run the tests successfully, you need be logged in to your Meshery account. This is required to access the Meshery Server and perform operations on it. Whether using the local or a remote provider, you will need to generate a token from your user account to use while writing and executing tests.

**Remote Provider Example**

If you are using Layer5 Cloud as your remote provider, you can [generate and download an API token](https://cloud.layer5.io/security/tokens) from your user account for use while writing and executing tests.

### Verify your API Token

```bash
mesheryctl system check
```

If you need to authenticate, you will see the following message

```bash
Error: !! Authentication token not found. Please supply a valid user token. Login with `mesheryctl system login`
```

### Starting Meshery Server

There are a few ways to set up the Meshery server, but for end-to-end testing, we aim to get as close to a production environment as possible. We know developers might need to make some tweaks for Server. Rebuilding the whole project can take time, and we donâ€™t support hot reload because itâ€™s more for development than for end-to-end testing.

```bash
make server
```

Be aware that some test cases require the availability of a Kubernetes cluster and one or more  Meshery Adapters. In those cases, please refer to the [installation guides]{{site.baseurl}}/installation) (like that of [installing Meshery on Minikube]({{site.baseurl}}/installation/kubernetes/minikube)). 

### Setup Bats Core

For Bats Core, always try to use a BATS-native OS whenever possible. This is because BATS Core does not support Windows. If you are using Windows, you can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run BATS Core. See the official [BATS installation documentation](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for more information on how to install BATS Core on your system. Here are quick start steps.

#### MacOS (homebrew)

```bash
brew install bats-core
```

#### Any OS (npm)

```bash
npm install -g bats
```

#### Windows (from source via bash)

Check out a copy of the Bats repository and install it to $HOME. This will place the bats executable in $HOME/bin, which will need to be added in $PATH.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
cd bats-core
./install.sh $HOME
```

Some tests could use bats libraires as helpers to create the tests suite.

## Writing End-to-End Test Cases

Once all prerequisites have been met, you are setup to run, add, update new test cases.To keep the development of tests consistents and maintainable, we have put some guidance on implementation process which are describe above.

### Folder structure

The tests will be available in[`mesheryctl/tests/e2e`](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/mesheryctl/tests/e2e) folder with the following structure which is done to follow the code base structure of `mesheryctl`.

```shell
â”œâ”€â”€ aaa-<command>
â”œâ”€â”€ bbb-<command>
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ yyy-<command>
â”œâ”€â”€ zzz-<command>
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ run_tests.bash
â”œâ”€â”€ setup_suite.bash
â””â”€â”€ teardown_suite.bash
```

### Test Case Naming Convention

Bats will run the tests sequentially so we use a prefix code alphanumeric to be able to order tests as required  when necessary. The prefix code is used to order the tests in a way that makes sense for the command under test. The prefix code is used to group the tests by command and subcommand. The prefix code is also used to order the tests within the command and subcommand. For example, you need to import a [Meshery Model]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/models) before being able to view the details of that model

**Test Folder**
- **prefix**: 3 digits alphanumeric code
- **name**: command under test
  
Example: `011-design`

**Test File**

- **prefix**: 2 digits numeric code
- **name**: subcommand under test
- **extension**: bats

Example: `05-list.bats`

For consistency, we will keep the prefix *00-* for the command under test in the folder and subcommands will start at *01-*. Here an example with `mesheryctl model` command:

```bash
002-model/
â”œâ”€â”€ 00-model.bats
â””â”€â”€ 01-model-list.bats
```

### Run End-to-End (locally)

<!-- 
    TODO: Add make e2e support with following changes
    1. move to tests/e2e/helpers
    2. Assert the following lbats libraries are available if not git clone
    - https://github.com/bats-core/bats-file.git
    - https://github.com/bats-core/bats-detik.git
    - https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support.git
    3. back to tests/e2e
    5. run bats *-*/*.bats

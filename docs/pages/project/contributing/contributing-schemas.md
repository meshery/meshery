### Overview
Meshery follows schema-driven development. As a project, Meshery has different types of schemas. Some schemas are external facing, and some internal to Meshery itself. This repository serves as a central location for storing schemas from which all Meshery components can take reference.

The schemas follow a versioned approach to maintain backward compatibility while allowing for the evolution of the definitions.

{% include alert.html type="info" title="Meshery Documentation Core Concepts" content="To better understand how schemas fit into Meshery's architecture, read about Meshery's core concepts in the <a href='https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical'>Meshery documentation</a>.`" %}

### Prerequisites
- **oapi-codegen**: This tool is essential for generating Go code from OpenAPI specifications. Install it using:

```bash
go install github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest
```

- **make**: The repository uses Makefiles to automate various tasks. Ensure you have make installed on your system.

### Development Workflow


#### **Schema Definition in Meshery**
Meshery uses **OpenAPI v3** specification to define schemas. Given the complexity of the project, where multiple constructs and APIs exist, we adopt a structured approach to schema management:
- **Schemas are versioned** to maintain backward compatibility.
- **Schemas are modular** to support different components of Meshery independently.
- **Schemas are used for validation, API definition, and automatic code generation.**

### **Schema Directory Structure**
All schemas are stored in the **`schemas`** directory at the root of the project. The structure follows:

```
schemas/
  constructs/
    <schema-version>/  # e.g., v1beta1
      <construct>/  # e.g., model, component
        <construct>.json    # Schema definition for the construct (noun)
        subschemas/         # Any subschemas used within the construct
        openapi.yml         # OpenAPI schema defining API operations (verbs like create, update, delete)
```

### **Explanation**
- **`constructs/`** â€“ Contains schemas for different versions.
- **`<schema-version>/`** â€“ Each schema version (e.g., `v1beta1`, `v1alpha2`) is a separate directory.
- **`<construct>/`** â€“ Each construct (e.g., `capability`, `category`) has its own folder.
- **`<construct>.json`** â€“ Defines the **schema for the noun** (i.e., the entity).
- **`subschemas/`** â€“ Contains reusable subschemas for modularity.
- **`openapi.yml`** â€“ Defines **API operations** (verbs: `create`, `update`, `delete`) and serves as the **entry point** for the schema.

This approach ensures that **schemas are well-organized, reusable, and scalable** across different Meshery components.

## **Adding a New Schema**

To add a new schema, follow these steps:
1. **Create a new directory** under `schemas/constructs/` for the new schema version.
2. **Create a new directory** for the construct under the version directory.
3. **Define the schema** in JSON format and save it as `<construct>.json`.
4. **Create a subschemas directory** if needed, and add any reusable subschemas.
5. **Define the OpenAPI schema** in `openapi.yml` to specify API operations.
6. **Update the `generate.sh` script** to include the new schema for code generation.
7. **Run the code generation script** to generate the necessary code files.



## **Code Generation**
Meshery supports **automatic code generation** for:
- **Golang** (structs and types)
- **TypeScript** (interfaces and types)

### **Generating Code from Schemas**
The schema-to-code mapping is defined in **`generate.sh`**, which automates the generation process.

#### **Generating Golang Models**
To generate Go structs from schemas, use:
```bash
make golang-generate
```

This also generates a merged_openapi.yml file which can be used to generate the redoc documentation and for rtk-api

#### **Generating TypeScript Models**
To generate TypeScript types and and ts objects for the schemas use:
```bash
make generate-ts
```

This will generate the typescript types and also javascript objects for the schemas
the javascript objects can be used to do run time validation of data or for getting information from the schema


### **Schema-to-Code Mapping**
Example mapping in **`generate.sh`**:
```bash
generate_schema_models <construct> <schema-version>
generate_schema_models "capability" "v1alpha1"
generate_schema_models "category" "v1beta1"
generate_schema_models "component" "v1beta1"
generate_schema_models "pattern" "v1beta1" "schemas/constructs/v1beta1/design/openapi.yml"
generate_schema_models "core" "v1alpha1"
generate_schema_models "catalog" "v1alpha2"
```
- The **package name matches the construct name**.
- Example: For the `capability` construct in `v1alpha1`, the generated Go code will be in:
  ```
  models/v1alpha1/capability/capability.go
  ```

### **Example Output**
```bash
./generate-golang.sh
ðŸ”¹ Processing: capability (v1alpha1)...
âœ… Generated: models/v1alpha1/capability/capability.go
ðŸ”¹ Processing: category (v1beta1)...
âœ… Generated: models/v1beta1/category/category.go
ðŸ”¹ Processing: pattern (v1beta1)...
âœ… Generated: models/v1beta1/pattern/pattern.go
ðŸ”¹ Processing: core (v1alpha1)...
âœ… Generated: models/v1alpha1/core/core.go
ðŸ”¹ Processing: catalog (v1alpha2)...
âœ… Generated: models/v1alpha2/catalog/catalog.go
```

This ensures that schemas remain the **single source of truth**, making development **efficient, consistent, and scalable**.

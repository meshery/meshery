To automate functional integration and end-to-end testing Meshery uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as one of the tools to automate browser testing. End-to-end tests run with each pull request to ensure that the changes do not break the existing functionality.

## Prerequisites:

Before diving into Meshery's testing environment, certain prerequisites are necessary:

- A verified account in your choosen provider which integrate with Meshery.
- A compatible browser such as Chromium, Chrome, or Firefox.
- Installations of Golang, NodeJS, and Makefiles for Native OS build (Optional for docker based build).
- Kubernetes clusters (Required for connection to Kubernetes test cases)
- Already have [Meshery Adapters](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/adapters) up and running (Required for adapters test cases)

## Setting up environment variable

To run the tests successfully, three environment variables must be configured:  
• `REMOTE_PROVIDER_USER_EMAIL`: The email associated with your account within your provider.  
• `REMOTE_PROVIDER_USER_PASSWORD` : The password associated with your account within your provider.  
• `PROVIDER_TOKEN`: Your provider token, can be generated from an account registered within your provider  

{% include alert.html
    type="info"
    title="Layer5 Cloud Provider"
    content='In the case you are using Layer5 Cloud as provider, you can generate your token on <a href="https://cloud.layer5.io/security/tokens">Layer5 cloud account token</a>' %}

During the setup phase, Playwright utilizes these environment variables to log in and store credentials securely in the `playwright/.auth` directory. To protect sensitive data, the `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude the `.env` file and any JSON files within the `/playwright/.auth` directory from the GitHub repository.

There are several tools to help you to working with environment variables locally for each project such as [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), it can work across multiple shell such as Bash, Powershell, Oh my zsh, Fish, etc

## Starting up Meshery UI and Server

There are a few ways to set up the Meshery UI and server, but for end-to-end testing, we aim to get as close to a production environment as possible. We know developers might need to make some tweaks for UI and Server. Rebuilding the whole project can take time, and we don’t support hot reload because it’s more for development than for end-to-end testing.

{% include alert.html type="warning" title="Several Test may break" content='Some test cases required you to have kubernetes cluster and build meshery adapter as well, be aware of that. Which is out of scope for this documentation<ul><li><a href="https://docs.meshery.io/installation/kubernetes/minikube">Kubernetes Cluster</a>: Instalation of kubernetes cluster with Minikube.</li>

### Native OS (Recommended)

This approach is very quick to build, but also dependent on your operating system, so you need to have all dependencies necessary to be able compile and running the server.

- Install & Build the NextJS application for both the UI and UI Provider

```bash
make ui-build
```

- Compile the Golang into binary file for Meshery Server

```bash
make build-server
```

- Run the Meshery Server on localhost port 9081

```bash
make server-binary
```

### Meshery CLI

There is also Meshery CLI which can help you run the UI and Server, for more detail, you go to [Meshery CLI documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide#process)

### Docker Based

Alternatively, a Docker-based setup can be utilized, simplifying the process, and ensuring consistency across different environments. It is closer to the production environment than the native solution but slower in terms of build time.

- Build the docker container locally:

```bash
make docker-testing-env-build
```

- Run the docker container on port 9081

```bash
make docker-testing-env
```

## Setup playwright & Run the test cases

For playwrights, always try to use a native OS whenever possible. The Docker-based approach is intended only for unsupported OSes and is generally not recommended because it runs on top of Ubuntu images, which can be redundant if you already using Ubuntu or Windows.

### Native OS (Recommended)

Setup playwright:

```bash
make test-setup-ui
```

Run the test cases:

```bash
make test-ui
```

### Docker based

The first step is to pull the docker image from [Azure Container Registry](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/playwright/tags) where the playwright stores their image using this command:

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:<version>-<base-image>
```

{% include alert.html type="warning" title="Playwright Versioning" content="Make sure the version you are using matches the version of `@playwright/test` in the `package.json` dev dependencies" %}

Here is the example of pulling playwright v1.44.0 with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy
```

Starting up playwright docker server:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host --init -it mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy /bin/sh -c "cd /home/pwuser && npx -y playwright@1.44.0 run-server --port 8080"
```

{% include alert.html type="warning" title="Unsafe Environment" content="Keep in mind this is just for development purposes inside your local system and don’t try to expose your container network to the host system using --network host on production or CI" %}

In the last step go to ui folder, 
```bash
cd ui;
```

And run this command for running the test cases:
```bash
PW_TEST_CONNECT_WS_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:8080/ npx playwright test
```

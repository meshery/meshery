[Meshery Models](/concepts/logical/models) are a way to represent the architecture of a system or application. Models are defined in JSON and can be used to visualize the components and relationships between them. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new model.

[Meshery Components](/concepts/logical/components) are the building blocks of a model. Each component represents a different part of the system or application. Components can be anything from a database to a microservice to a server. Relationships define how components interact with each other. For example, a database component might have a relationship with a microservice component that represents the microservice's dependency on the database.

### Creating your first Meshery Model

To get started quickly, check out the [Generating Models](/guides/configuration-management/generating-models)  guide for step-by-step instructions.

### Contributing a Model Definition

1. Fork the [meshery/meshery.io](https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io) repository.
1. Create a new branch in your fork of the meshery/meshery.io repository.
1. Add your model definition to the `collections/_models` directory.
1. Create a pull request to the meshery/meshery.io repository.
1. Once your pull request is merged, your model will be available in the next Meshery release.

## Next Steps

To learn more about how to contribute and customize your models, check out the full [Contributing to Models](/project/contributing/contributing-models/) documentation. We encourage you to get involved in the development of Meshery Models and to share your feedback!

As the cloud native manager, Meshery offers support for more infrastructure than any other project. Meshery uses adapters to offer choice of load generator (for performance management) and for managing different layers of your infrastructure.

## What are Meshery Adapters?

Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure, exposing their differentiated value to users.

Meshery has adapters for managing the following cloud native infrastructure.
{% assign sorted = site.adapters | sort: "project_status" | reverse %}

| Adapter Status | Adapter | Port | Earliest Version supported |
| :------------: | :----------: | :--: | :------------------------: |
{% for adapter in sorted -%}
{% if adapter.project_status -%}
| {{ adapter.project_status }} | <img src="{{ adapter.image }}" style="width:20px" data-logo-for-dark="{{ adapter.white_image }}" data-logo-for-light="{{ adapter.image }}" id="logo-dark-light" loading="lazy"/> [{{ adapter.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ adapter.url }}) | {{ adapter.port }} | {{adapter.earliest_version}} |
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

### Adapter FAQs

#### Is each Meshery adapter made equal?

No, different Meshery adapters are written to expose the unique value of each cloud native infrastructure. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each cloud native infrastructure is not equally capable as the other.

Adapters have a set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types. See the [extensibility]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility) page for more details on adapter operations.

#### How can I create a new adapter?

See the [extensibility]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility) documentation for details on how new Meshery adapters are made.

#### Can I run more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter?

The default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the `meshery-istio` adapter. To do so, modify ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml to include multiple copies of the given adapter.

See the "[Multiple Adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/multiple-adapters)" guide for more information.

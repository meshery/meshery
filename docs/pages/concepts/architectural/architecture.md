## Components, their Purpose, and Languages

Meshery and its components are written using the following languages and technologies.

## Deployments

Meshery deploys as a set of containers. Meshery's containers can be deployed to either Docker or Kubernetes. Meshery components connect to one another via gRPC requests. Meshery Server stores the location of the other components and connects with those components as needed. Typically, a connection from Meshery Server to Meshery Adapters is initiated from a client request (usually either `mesheryctl` or Meshery UI) to gather information from the Adapter or invoke an Adapter's operation.

### Adapters

In Meshery v0.6.0, Adapters will register with Meshery Server over HTTP POST. If Meshery Server is not available, Meshery Adapters will backoff and retry to connect to Meshery Server perpetually.

#### Adapters and Capabilities Registry

Each Meshery Adapter delivers its own unique specific functionality. As such, at time of deployment, the Meshery Adapter will register its cloud native infrastructure-specific capabilities (its operations) with Meshery Server's capability registry.

### Clients

Meshery's REST API may be consumed by any number of clients. Clients need to present valid JWT token.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/architecture/Meshery-client-architecture.svg" width="50%" /></a>

_Figure: Clients use Meshery's [REST API](/extensibility/api#rest), [GraphQL API](/extensibility/api#graphql), or a combination of both._

### Providers

As a point of extensibility, Meshery supports two types of [providers](/extensibility/providers): _Local_ and _Remote_.

## Meshery Operator and MeshSync

Meshery Operator is the multi-cluster Kubernetes operator that manages MeshSync and Meshery Broker.

See the [**Operator**]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/operator) section for more information on the function of an operator and [**MeshSync**]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/meshsync) section for more information on the function of meshsync.

## Database

Meshery Server's database is responsible for collecting and centralizing the state of all elements under management, including infrastructure, application, and Meshery's own components. Meshery's database, while persisted to file, is treated as a cache.

_See the [**Database**]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/database) section for more information on the function of the database._

## Meshery Docker Extension

Meshery's Docker extension provides a simple and flexible way to design and operate cloud native infrastructure on top of Kubernetes using Docker containers. The architecture of this extension is designed to be modular and extensible, with each component serving a specific purpose within the overall deployment process.

<figure>

## Meshery CLI

The Command Line Interface ( also known as [mesheryctl](/guides/mesheryctl/working-with-mesheryctl) ) that is used to manage Meshery. Use `mesheryctl` to both manage the lifecycle of Meshery itself and to access and invoke any of Meshery's application and cloud native management functions.

### **Statefulness in Meshery components**

Some components within Meshery's architecture are concerned with persisting data while others are only
concerned with a long-lived configuration, while others have no state at all.

| Components        | Persistence  | Description                                                           |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [mesheryctl](/guides/mesheryctl/working-with-mesheryctl)        | stateless    | command line interface that has a configuration file                  |
| [Meshery Adapters](/concepts/architecture/adapters)  | stateless    | interface with cloud native infrastructure on a transactional basis                |
| Meshery Server    | caches state | application cache is stored in `$HOME/.meshery/` folder               |
| [Meshery Providers](/extensibility/providers) | stateful     | location of persistent user preferences, environment, tests and so on |
| [Meshery Operator](/concepts/architecture/operator)  | stateless    | operator of Meshery custom controllers, notably MeshSync              |
| [MeshSync](/concepts/architecture/meshsync)          | stateless    | Kubernetes custom controller, continuously running discovery          |

### **Network Ports**

Meshery uses the following list of network ports to interface with its various components:

{% for adapter in site.adapters -%}
{% if adapter.port -%}
{% capture adapter-ports %}
| <img src="{{ adapter.image }}" style="width:20px" /> [{{ adapter.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ adapter.url }}) | {{ adapter.port }}/gRPC | Communication with Meshery Server |
{% endcapture %}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

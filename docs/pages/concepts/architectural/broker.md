Broker is a custom Kubernetes controller that provides data streaming across independent components of Meshery whether those components are running inside or outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

### Broker FAQs

#### How many Brokers can run?
It is recommended to run one broker instance for each kubernetes cluster, However the instance itself can be scaled up based on the incoming data volume in each of the cluster. The scaling is independent of the number of instances running.

#### What does an HA configuration look like?
We leverage on the kubernetes functionality in terms of the High-Availability behaviour. Meaning, the broker instance gets instantiated/restarted on its own when an issue occurs. In part, Meshery-Operator is also responsible for keeping the broker functional.

#### What stateful characteristics does the Broker have?
All the messages that are published to the broker is persisted in-memory within the broker instance until it get consumed. Persistent-volume/Disk-space is not currently being used by the Broker.

#### How do I know if the Broker is working? How do I troubleshoot the Broker?
To check if your Broker instance is running smoothly (it's deployed as a Kubernetes StatefulSet), follow these quick checks:

- Confirm that the Broker pods are running.
- Verify your cluster supports `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` service types.
- Make sure the Meshery Server can reach the Broker service.

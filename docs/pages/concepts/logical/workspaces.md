## Workspaces

Workspaces act as central collaboration points for teams and their project work. Often, users create a Workspace for each project or for each team as a way of organizing domains of project work to facilitate collaboration and provide access control over resources with a project. Workspaces are sometimes likened to the concept of a project - a collection of individuals responsible for the development and operation of an application or service.

### Using Workspaces
After creating a Workspace, of your next steps is to resource that Workspace. Like a shared drive (or or shared collection of files). Workspaces are your Google Drive, while Meshery Designs are your Google Docs.


### Workspace Relationships and Restrictions
- Access to Workspaces may be granted to one or more teams.
- As a point of collaboration to facilitate work, Workspaces may have zero or more Environments associated.

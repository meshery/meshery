[Components](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/server/meshmodel/components) represent entities in the Meshery ecosystem, exposing capabilities of the underlying platform. They can be registered, created, and used by users and operators. Components have definitions, instances, and associated metadata. Components having the same `kind`, `apiVersion` and `model.name` attributes are considered duplicates.

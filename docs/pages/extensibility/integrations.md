Meshery provides 220+ built-in integrations which refer to the supported connections and interactions between Meshery and various cloud native platforms, tools, and technologies. Meshery's approach is Kubernetes-native which means you can easily incorporate Meshery into your existing workflow without additional setup or integration effort.

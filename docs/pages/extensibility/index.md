Meshery has an extensible architecture with several different types of extension points.

 <!-- via [adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/adapters), different [load generators]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/load-generators) and different [providers]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/providers). Meshery also offers a REST API. -->

## Extension Points

Meshery is not just an application. It is a set of microservices where the central component is itself called Meshery. Integrators may extend Meshery by taking advantage of designated Extension Points. Extension points come in various forms and are available through Mesheryâ€™s architecture.

## Types of Extension Points

The following points of extension are currently incorporated into Meshery.

{% assign sorted = site.pages | sort: "extensibility" %}

<ul>
    {% for item in sorted %}
    {% if item.type=="Extensibility" and item.list!="exclude" and item.language !="es"  -%}
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a>
      {% if item.abstract != " " %}
              - {{ item.abstract }}
            {% endif %}
            </li>
            {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

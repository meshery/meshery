## Meshery's APIs

Each of Meshery's APIs are subject to the following authentication and authorization system.
Currently, Meshery requires a valid token in order to allow clients to invoke its APIs.

{% include alert.html type="dark" title="What are authentication tokens?" content="Meshery authentication tokens allow users or systems to authenticate with Meshery Server via either its two clients, <a href='/reference/mesheryctl'>Meshery >CLI</a> and <a href='/extensibility/api#how-to-get-your-token'>UI</a>, or its two APIs: <a href='/reference/rest-apis'>REST</a> or <a href='/reference/graphql-apis'>GraphQL</a>. <p>Meshery's authentication token system provide secure access to Meshery's powerful management features.</p>" %}

<details>
  <summary>Authentication</summary>
  Requests to any of the API endpoints must be authenticated and include a valid JWT access token in the HTTP headers. Type of authentication is determined by the selected [Provider](#providers). Use of the Local Provider, "None", puts Meshery into single-user mode and does not require authentication.
</details>

### How to get your token

There are two ways to get your authentication token:

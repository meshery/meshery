## Meshery Design

We know in the world of microservice architecture, **service meshes** are crucial. And it comes with a **heptic price** (complexity, error-prone).

### We are here to help you out with **Meshery Designs**.


## WHAT IS IT ?
**Here**, we have pre-build configuration yaml files that serve as a blueprint for the configuration of various service-mesh components. So that you dont need to bother for writing config files for your mesh & make things aggravated. <br>
when you apply the config files on kubernetes cluster. The service-mesh control plane reads the instructions (from the config file) & takes the necessary steps to setup the desired service-mesh environment. This help you to use your service-mesh's potential with prior experience of it. Like 

* Configure control plane
* Define traffic routing rules
* Implement security policies
* Configure observability


Along all these we provide an opportuinity to create or import you own config files.

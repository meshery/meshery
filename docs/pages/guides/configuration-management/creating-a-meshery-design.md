## Ways to create a Meshery Design

You can create a Meshery design in two ways:

### From scratch

1. Click on the "Design" tab to start creating a new design.
2. In the left panel, click "Components" and browse the type of component you want to add.
3. Drag and drop the components onto the canvas.
4. Click and drag from one component to another to create connections between components. You can customize the connections by adding labels or adjusting their properties.
5. Once you're satisfied with your design, click the "Save" button on the toolbar. Your design will be saved as "Untitled design" by default. You can give your design a name to help identify and manage it later.

### From a template

Another way to create a Meshery design is to use an already curated template. You can either import designs that others have published and made available for public use or clone patterns from the Meshery Catalog.

#### Importing published designs

1. In the left panel of the designer mode, click "Designs".
2. Select a design from the list that appears in the panel and it will appear on your canvas.
3. If you already have a design that you'd like to build on, click on the import icon to import the design directly to your Kanvas canvas.
4. A modal will pop-up where you'll then select the design type, choose the upload method (file upload or url import), enter the design file name, and choose the file to upload or enter the url link to import.

#### Cloning patterns from Catalog

1. In the left panel of the designer mode, click "Catalog".
2. Select a design from the list that appears in the panel.
3. A modal will pop up requesting you to clone (create a copy of) the design you've selected.
4. Click "clone" and a copy of the design will appear on your Kanvas canvas. You can then configure the design to suit your purposes.

9. Locate the **Save As** icon in the top right, once the pop up modal opens, give your design a name, then click save.
[![Save CronJob]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/meshmap/save.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/meshmap/save.png)

10. Thereafter click on the **Action** drop down menu also located in the top right and click on the **Deploy** option.
[![Deploy CronJob]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/meshmap/deploy.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/meshmap/deploy.png)
11. In the pop-up window, review and correct any errors as necessary. Then, click the deploy button.
[![Deploy CronJob]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/meshmap/deploy-app.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/meshmap/deploy-app.png)
12. You'll receive a confirmation message indicating that your app has been successfully deployed.

#### 4. **Verifying CronJob Execution:**
   - Monitor the execution of the CronJob and verify that backups are created at the specified intervals.

To view the resources created for the CronJob, we will utilize the Visualize tab of the MeshMap. A view will be created with necessary filters to display the relevant resources.

   1. Ensure that you are on the Visualize tab, located at the top center of the canvas.
   2. Give the view a name.
   3. Click on the filter icon.
   4. Choose appropriate filters; for this lab, select the kind item that was set earlier during the CronJob creation, i.e., 'CronJob'.
   5. Click the filter icon again to close. This action should display a filtered view with only your resources, similar to the screenshot below:

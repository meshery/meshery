## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will delve into the world of Kubernetes Deployments, a key resource for managing and scaling containerized applications. Utilizing Meshery Playground, an interactive live cluster environment, we'll conduct hands-on labs to gain practical experience in deploying and managing applications using Kubernetes Deployments.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts.
- Meshery Playground access. If you don't have an account, sign up at [Meshery Playground](https://meshery.layer5.io/play).


#### creating a standalone deployment
 Here is the deployment.yaml we are going use for this tutorial 

 ``` yaml
 apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```


   1. In the MeshMap screen, rename the design from _Untitled Design_ to a name of choice. This helps in identifying the design later easily.
   2. Click **Components** tab.

   3. Search for **deployment** in the list of components and choose only kubenetes deployment with the bellow symbol .

   4. Scroll down, _select and drag_ the **deployment** component from the search results to the design canvas on the right.
   5. After successfully drop the **deployment** component into canvas ,double click on deployment to enter configurations.
   6. Rename the **deployment** to **nginxdeployment**  or any desired name .

### Setting minimum no of replicas for autohealing capability

   7. In the Spec section , U  will have an option to define **replicas**, fill that with ur desired number of replicas and  for this tutorial we can use three replicas as the base minimum .

   8. Scroll down for **selector** section , click on it for two options and  as per the above **deployment.yaml** file  , fill the      **matchlabels** section  as per the  requirements .
  ![](./screenshots/6.png)
   9. Scroll to down last until u find **template** section , click on it and select the spec option .
  ![](./screenshots/7.png)

   10. In this Spec section , scroll down untill find containers section .
   11. Click **+** to add a container.
   12. Next, fill out some of the required container specifications. Start by entering the container image, we will use _nginx:latest_ for this exercise.
   ![](./screenshots/8.png)
   13. Give the container a name and explore the other options too .


   14. after filling out containers section , scroll down untill u get ports section .
   15. Click **+** to add a port .
   ![](./screenshots/9(1).png)
   16. Fill the ports as per requirement and also  choose protocol type like TCP ,STCP etc

   17. Explore Spec ,there are many options to include like voulumes ,volume mounts ,resources etc.
   ![](./screenshots/10.png)

   18. After this all operation , go back to starting where we have defiend deployment name , replicas etc ,there u will three options of symbols at left side , click on 2nd symbol where labels and annotations are defined .
   ![](./screenshots/11.png)
   19. Click on the labels section and fill it with key and value as app and nginx respectively .
   ![](./screenshots/12(new).png)
   18. after this u can see a golden layer is present behind deployment .


### validating and deploying the deployment
   19. After this whole process , click on validate button to have an validation of errors before deployment.
   ![](./screenshots/13.png)

   **Note** - Before clicking on deploy ,ensure that u are connected to kubernetes cluster and there are no errors displayed .
   20. Click on deploy .

   21. After your depolyed your resource ,automatically a nofication will be appeared at left side of screen .

   22. Congrats,here u have your first deployemnt deployed in meshery playground.

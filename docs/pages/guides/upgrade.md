## Upgrading Meshery Server, Adapters, and UI

Various components of Meshery will need to be upgraded as new releases become available. Meshery is comprised of a number of components including a server, adapters, UI, and CLI. As an application, Meshery is a composition of different functional components.

Some of the components must be upgraded simultaneously, while others may be upgraded independently. The following table depicts components, their versions, and deployment units (deployment groups).

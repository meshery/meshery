When you add a cluster to the Meshery Server, you might see this warning:

<img class="center" style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/troubleshoot/out-of-cluster-connectivity-error.png" alt="Out-of-cluster connectivity warning" />

> **‚ö†Ô∏è No reachable contexts found in the uploaded kubeconfig `file_name`**

## üåê What Does "Out-of-Cluster" Mean?

An _out-of-cluster installation_ means the **Meshery Server** runs **outside your target environment** (for example, as a standalone binary, in a Docker container, or in another Kubernetes cluster).

The **Meshery Operator** and workloads still run **inside your target cluster**.

In this setup, the Meshery Server must **directly reach your cluster‚Äôs API server URL**.

---

## üîç Debugging Steps

Follow these steps to fix the connectivity issue:

### 1. Open your kubeconfig file

By default, the file is here:

```bash
~/.kube/config
```

### 2. Find the Cluster API Server URL

Look for the `server` field in your kubeconfig:

```yaml
clusters:
  - cluster:
      server: https://<ip-address>:<port>
```

This field contains the Kubernetes API server URL.

### 3. Test Connectivity from Meshery Server

- If Meshery runs **on your host machine**, test access with:

  ```bash
  curl -k https://<ip-address>:<port>
  ```

- If Meshery runs **inside a container or pod**, connect to it and test from inside:

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it <meshery-server-pod> -- curl -k https://<ip-address>:<port>
  ```

If the tests fail, Meshery cannot communicate with the cluster.

### 4. Configure Firewall and Network Rules

Make sure you:

- Allow **outbound** traffic from the Meshery Server host/container to the Kubernetes API server IP and port.
- Allow **inbound** responses from the API server back to Meshery.
- Verify that your load balancer or cloud provider endpoint is reachable from where Meshery runs.

Once the Meshery Server can reach the Kubernetes API server, the warning will disappear when you add the cluster.

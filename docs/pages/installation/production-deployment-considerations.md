# Meshery Production Best Practices

## 1. Introduction

- Purpose of the document
- Target audience (Meshery users preparing for production)
- Scope (considerations, not step-by-step installation)

## 2. Infrastructure & Resource Requirements

- High Availability setup (multi-node, multi-AZ, load balancing)
- Scalability planning (auto-scaling, cloud infrastructure options)
- Capacity planning and resource allocation
- Networking basics (Kubernetes cluster connectivity, firewall rules)
- Performance baselines and SLA/SLO definitions

## 3. Security Considerations

- Secure communication (ports, TLS, directional traffic)
- Ingress controller configuration for secure WebSockets
- Authentication & authorization (a Remote Provider, OAuth callback URL, health checks)
- Security compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Vulnerability management and security scanning
- Secret management and rotation policies

## 4. Monitoring & Logging

- Resource allocation monitoring (CPU, memory, storage)
- Comprehensive monitoring metrics (API latency, error rates, system load)
- Centralized logging setup (log aggregation, analysis tools)
- Alerting strategy (critical events, performance issues)
- Change management and deployment strategies
- Configuration management and version control
- Environment promotion workflows

## 5. Operational Best Practices

- Routine maintenance and upgrades
- Backup & restore strategies
- Scaling procedures and rollback plans

## 6. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- Disaster recovery planning and procedures
- Business continuity requirements
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Data backup and restoration strategies
- Cross-region failover procedures
- Testing and validation of recovery procedures

## 7. Troubleshooting
- Common deployment issues and solutions
- Performance bottlenecks identification and resolution
- Connectivity and networking problems
- Resource constraints and scaling issues
- Log analysis and debugging techniques
- Recovery procedures for critical failures
- Diagnostic tools and utilities

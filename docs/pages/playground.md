_Try out Meshery Playground at [https://playground.meshery.io/](https://playground.meshery.io/)_

Meshery Playground is a web-based, collaborative environment that provides you with the ability to explore not only Meshery as a cloud native manager, but also all of the infrastructure that it manages, including multiple Kubernetes clusters, every CNCF project and application, service, or operator that runs on Kubernetes. Meshery Playground provides a sandboxed environment to experiment with different infrastructure configurations and deployment options. Its multi-player plugins allow you to collaborate in real-time with your teammates on infrastructure design and operation.

With Meshery Playground, you can:

- Collaborate with other engineers, share your knowledge, and exchange ideas
- Explore new cloud native tools without the need for complex setup or configuration. Simply open your browser and go.
- Design new cloud native scenarios and easily deploy them in the Playground environment. Keep your designs and deploy them in your own environment when youâ€™re ready.


You can interactively explore any service mesh like Istio, Linkerd, Consul, Kuma, and so on without having to install them on your local machine. You can create virtual services and deploy sample applications using these meshes and observe their behavior in real-time.

Meshery Playground also has pre-built scenarios that demonstrate how to implement specific use-cases such as traffic splitting, circuit breaking, and other cloud native patterns.

## Meshery Playground FAQ
#### Question: Why do I need to sign-up/register to use the Cloud Native Playground?
**Answer:** _The Playground is connected to live Kubernetes clusters, and while these clusters are refreshed on a daily basis, the clusters do need to be protected from nefarious actors, who might use these clusters for cryptomining, for example._

_Sign-up to receive a user account, entitled with perpetually free and full access the Playground environment._

_The Meshery Playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full-control over those clusters. Requiring users to register a user account keeps the Playground safe and healthy for all to enjoy. Without requiring users to sign-in, the Meshery Playground would allow anonymous access for anyone and everyone to potentially perform nefarious acts._


#### Question: Will I lose my Meshery designs in the Cloud Native Playground?
**Answer:** _No, all of the designs that you have created in the Meshery Playground are saved to your user account and will be available to you each time you sign into your account. Your designs will be available in the Meshery Playground and any your other Meshery deployments, too._

_In other words, all work done in MeshMap Designer is persisted to your user account._


#### Question: Will I lose my Meshery deployments in the Cloud Native Playground?
**Answer:** _Yes, the Meshery Playground clusters are reset on a daily basis. However, only deployments (not designs) that you may have created will be lost._

_In other words, only MeshMap Visualizer is reset. All of your work in Meshery UI and MeshMap Designer will remain in your user account._

#### Question: Is there a demo user account that everyone can use? 
**Answer:** _It is imperative that each user has their own account to ensure seamless real-time collaboration within the Playground. The use of individual accounts is critical to enable multiple people to access and utilize the powerful collaboration features._

_Creating your own account ensures that any designs you create or save will be stored and accessible across sessions, preventing any loss of work._

_To ensure accountability in the Playground, it's crucial to promote the use of individual named accounts. This helps prevent bad actors from hiding behind anonymous general-use accounts and maliciously abusing the Playground. Therefore, the use of named accounts is an essential step towards achieving this goal._

### Question:Can I deploy the Meshery on-premises?
**Answer:** _Yes, Meshery can be deployed on-premises with a single command to download, install, and run your own instance of Meshery in your environment. See all supported platforms to deploy your own Meshery instance at https://meshery.io_

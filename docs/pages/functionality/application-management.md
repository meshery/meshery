Meshery's Application management features allows the users to store and onboard/offboard applications onto service meshes.

Users can define the applications as _Kubernetes manifest files\*_ as well as [pattern files](./patterns.md).

Meshery also comes with some sample applications out-of-the-box for users to quickly test out service meshes.

Users can also import application files from the filesystem, a URL or from a GitHub repository.

See [Guide: Application Management]() for a more detailed guide on working with your applications in Meshery.

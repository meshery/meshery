## Use Meshery to Deploy a Service Mesh Pattern

You can use Meshery to deploy a service mesh pattern. Service mesh patterns are detailed as a YAML file. The format of the YAML is based on the [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io) (SMP) specification.

### Pattern Repository

You may bring your own patterns or find them available through your chosen provider. Each service mesh pattern carries a unique identifier for reference. The patterns in this repository serve in an educational capacity, facilitating learning, and also serve in an operational capacity, facilitating implementation and validation of your service mesh deployment’s adherence to a pattern.

    title="Future Pattern Repository" 
    content="A central set of patterns will available in the <a href='https://github.com/service-mesh-patterns'>Service Mesh Patterns repository</a>. In this repository, you will find each of Meshery's patterns, which will also be available through the Local Provider." %}

## Sample Patterns

### Basic Istio Install

```
### 
pattern-id: MESHERY001
pattern-name: Basic Istio Install
service-mesh:				    # (required*) one or more service meshes
  istio-acme:				    # (required*) name of the instance mesh
    type: IstioMesh			    # (required*) type of service mesh
    namespace: istio-system		# (required*) control plane namespace required
    settings:				    # (optional) control and data plane settings
      version: 1.8.2			# (required) service mesh build version
      profile: demo				# (optional) reference to service mesh configuration
    traits:				    # (required) one or more configuration 
      mTLS:				    # (optional)
        policy: mutual			# (optional)
        namespaces:			  # (optional)
          - istio-test			 # (optional)
      automaticSidecarInjection:    # (optional)
        namespaces:			    # (optional)
          - default				# (optional)
          - istio-test			# (optional)
```        

### Duration-based Canary Rollout

```
pattern-id: MESHERY002
pattern-name: Duration-based Canary Rollout
namespace: meshy-app
settings:
    replicas: 5
    containers:
    - name: svc-demo
        image: layer5/meshy-app:v5
        ports:
        - name: http
        containerPort: 8080
        protocol: TCP
        resources:
        requests:
            memory: 32Mi
            cpu: 5m
    svcPorts:
    - 8080:8080
traits:
    strategy:
    canary:
        - setWeight: 20
        - pause: {duration: 60}
        - setWeight: 40
        - pause: {duration: 10}
        - setWeight: 60
        - pause: {duration: 10}
        - setWeight: 80
        - pause: {duration: 10}
```

### Sample Application

```
name: ApplicationPattern # display name in Meshery UI
services:
  myapp:
    type: Application
    namespace: test
    settings:
      replicas: 1
      containers:
        - name: meshy
          image: utkarsh23/meshy:v5
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
```

## Importing Patterns

You may import a pattern using `mesheryctl` or Meshery UI. Patterns can be imported from local filesystem, an HTTP/S endpoint, or from GitHub. When provided a GitHub location, Meshery will recursively search the given directory (or entire repository) for existing pattern files.

#### To import a pattern, execute this command:

```
$ mesheryctl pattern import -f <path to the pattern>
Importing pattern…
Pattern successfully imported.
```

#### To deploy a pattern, execute this command:

```
$ mesheryctl pattern apply -f <path to the pattern>
Deploying pattern…
Pattern successfully applied.
```

From here, output and behavior will vary based upon the specific pattern you’re deploying. Should you find that your pattern is not successfully deployed, refer to the pattern troubleshooting guide in the Meshery documentation.

As you step through each pattern, you might choose to modify the pattern to suit your specific environment and workload, exploring in-context of your specific situation. Optionally, you may choose to use a plugin like MeshMap, or another visual service mesh topology tool, to facilitate your comprehension of the patterns and to literally see the patterns in-action.

Take time to explore. Try deploying one service mesh’s sample application onto a different service mesh and compare differences in behavior and each service mesh’s ability to manage it. If using Meshery to do so, execute the following commands as an example to deploy the sample application, BookCatalog, onto Open Service Mesh:

```
$ mesheryctl pattern apply -f book-catalog
Deploying application “BookCatalog”...
Deployed. Endpoint(s) available at: http://localhost:8000/catalog
```

### Overview & Features:
2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kubeslice Worker

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. KubeSlice enables Kubernetes pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers by creating logical application boundaries known as Slices.

6. It combines network, application, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster, multi-tenant environment.

7. Ongoing synchronization of Kubernetes configuration and changes across any number of clusters.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

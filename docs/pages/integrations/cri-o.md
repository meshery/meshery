### Overview & Features:
1. Open Container Initiative-based implementation of Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for CRI-O

    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Supports multiple image formats including the existing Docker image format.

6. Container image management (managing image layers, overlay filesystems, etc).

7. Container process lifecycle management

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

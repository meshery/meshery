Capsule implements a multi-tenant and policy-based environment in your Kubernetes cluster. It is designed as a micro-services-based ecosystem with the minimalist approach, leveraging only on upstream Kubernetes.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.

### Overview & Features:
1. CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Coredns

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Serves zone data from a file; both DNSSEC (NSEC only) and DNS are supported (file and auto).

6. Retrieves zone data from primaries, i.e., act as a secondary server (AXFR only) (secondary).

7. Signs zone data on-the-fly (dnssec).

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

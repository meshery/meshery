<p>
Knative is a developer-focused serverless application layer which is a great complement to the existing Kubernetes application constructs. Knative consists of two components: an HTTP-triggered autoscaling container runtime called “Knative Serving”, and a CloudEvents-over-HTTP asynchronous routing layer called “Knative Eventing”.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
</p>

    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.

### Overview & Features:
1. Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration platform, born on Kubernetes, with serverless superpowers.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Camel K

4. Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.
Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud (Kubernetes or OpenShift).


    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Define routing and mediation rules in a variety of domain-specific languages.

6. Enables easier integration with all kinds of transport or messaging models.

7. Minimal dependencies for easy embedding in any Java application.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

### Overview & Features:
1. DevStream: the open-source DevOps toolchain manager (DTM).

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Devstream

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Centrally manage your toolchain with versioned code, and keep track of every change.

6. No reinvention of the wheels. Simply create a plugin, and connect any tools you like with DevStream.

7. Implement inbuilt best practices and share yours with the world.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

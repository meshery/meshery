### Overview & Features:
1. KubeVault is a Git-Ops ready, production-grade solution for deploying and configuring Hashicorp's Vault on Kubernetes.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kubevault Crds

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.

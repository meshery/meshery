### Overview & Features:
1. Enterprise service mesh based on Kuma for multi-cloud and multi-cluster on both Kubernetes and VMs.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kong Mesh

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Built on top of Envoy with 50+ observability charts out of the box, you can collect metrics, traces and logs of all L4-L7 traffic.

6. Integrate with Kong Ingress Controller to implement authentication, transformations, and other functionalities across Kubernetes clusters with zero downtime.

7. Configure Mesh natively using an API, web UI, or with declarative configuration to manage updates via your CI/CD pipelines.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

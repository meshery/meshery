### Overview & Features:
1. Confidential Containers is an open source community working to enable cloud native  confidential computing by leveraging Trusted Execution Environments to protect  containers and data.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Confidential Containers

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Manage AWS Elastic Load Balancers for a Kubernetes cluster.

6. Provide high performance traffic serving that can scale to millions of requests per second.

7. Supports IP address targeting mode for Network Load Balancers.

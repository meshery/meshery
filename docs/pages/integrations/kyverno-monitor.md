### Overview & Features:
1. Kubernetes Native Policy Management

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kyverno Monitor

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Use Meshery&ldquos GitHub Actions to test policies and validate resources without need for the Kyverno CLI.

6. Use Meshery with Kyverno to inspect image metadata and 
match resources using label selectors and wildcards.

7. Report Kyverno policy violations alongside your existing Meshery policy reports.


8. Block non-conformant resources

9. Using MeshMap, apply best practice design templates for admission control over non-conformant resources.

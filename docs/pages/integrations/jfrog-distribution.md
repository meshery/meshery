### Overview & Features:
1. The toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content

2. Managed release binary distribution with JFrog distribution

    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. JFrog Distribution is a centralized platform that lets you provision software release distribution

6. Structured platform to distribute release binaries as a single coherent release bundle.

7. Efficient network utilization by optimizing replication, dramatically reducing network load and release bundle synchronization time from source Artifactory to target instance or Edge node.

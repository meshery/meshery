<p>
Kong API Gateway is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins.
</p>
<p>
By providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and more), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic with ease.
</p>
<p>
Kong runs natively on Kubernetes thanks to its official Kubernetes Ingress Controller.</p>

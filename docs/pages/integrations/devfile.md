### Overview & Features:
1. Kube-native API for cloud development workspaces specification

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Devfile

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Development environments are quick to create, can be thrown away at will, and can be easily re-created when needed.

6. Mechanism for teams to share configurations across projects, and provide a single source of truth throughout the application lifecycle.

7. Central location management so updates can be applied once and be properly aligned across development teams.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

### Overview & Features:
1. Contour is a Kubernetes ingress controller using Envoy proxy.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Contour

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.

6. Introduces a new ingress API (HTTPProxy) which is implemented via a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

7. Solves shortcomings in the original design.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts, but includes domain-specific knowledge to automate the entire lifecycle of Contour.

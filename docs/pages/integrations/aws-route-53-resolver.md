### Overview & Features:

1. Amazon Route 53 Resolver responds recursively to DNS queries from AWS resources for public records, Amazon VPC-specific DNS names, and Amazon Route 53 private hosted zones, and is available by default in all VPCs.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for AWS Route 53 Resolver

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Local VPC domain names for EC2 instances (for example, ec2-192-0-2-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com).


6. Records in private hosted zones (for example, acme.example.com).


7. For public domain names, Route 53 Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers on the internet.


8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

### Overview & Features:
1. The Aperture Controller functions as the brain of the Aperture system. Leveraging an advanced control loop, the Controller routinely analyzes polled metrics and indicators to determine how traffic should be shaped as defined by set policies. Once determined, these decisions are then exported to all Aperture Agents to effectively handle workloads.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Aperture Controller

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Monitor golden signals to rapidly detect service deterioration and load build-up.

6. Adjusts the concurrency limit of the service.

7. Regulate and prioritize flows based on rules via a scheduler.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

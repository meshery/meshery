### Overview & Features:
1. Open-source layer 7 load balancer derived from proprietary Baidu FrontEnd

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for BFE

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. BFE has a builtin plugin framework that makes it possible to develop new features rapidly by writing plugins.

6. BFE is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance. Each tenant&ldquos configuration is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants

7. BFE provides an advanced domain-specific language to describe routing rules which are easy to understand and maintain.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

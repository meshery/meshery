### Overview & Features:
1. Kong API Gateway is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kong API Gateway

4. 
By providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and more), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic with ease.



Kong runs natively on Kubernetes thanks to its official Kubernetes Ingress Controller.


5. Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.

6. Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.

7. Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

### Overview & Features:
1. Progressive delivery Kubernetes operator (Canary, A/B Testing and Blue/Green deployments)

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Flagger

4. 
    Connect GitHub with Meshery and import selectively import your existing Helm Charts, Docker Compose applications, and Kubernetes manifests.Visually configure and customize your cloud native infrastructure.
    Save and share your design patterns to GitHub using either public or private repositories.



    Learn more about <a href="/blog/service-mesh-specifications/pipelining-service-mesh-specifications">pipelining service mesh specifications</a> and using Service Mesh Interface and Service Mesh Performance specs on your CI/CD pipelines with Meshery's GitHub Actions.



5. Canary (progressive traffic shifting), A/B Testing (HTTP headers and cookies traffic routing), Blue/Green (traffic switching and mirroring)

6. Flagger was designed to give developers confidence in automating production releases with progressive delivery techniques.

7. Reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics like HTTP/gRPC request success rate and latency.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

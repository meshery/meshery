### Overview & Features:
1. Progressive delivery Kubernetes operator (Canary, A/B Testing and Blue/Green deployments)

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Flagger

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Canary (progressive traffic shifting), A/B Testing (HTTP headers and cookies traffic routing), Blue/Green (traffic switching and mirroring)

6. Flagger was designed to give developers confidence in automating production releases with progressive delivery techniques.

7. Reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics like HTTP/gRPC request success rate and latency.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

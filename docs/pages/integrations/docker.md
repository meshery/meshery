### Overview & Features:
1. Develop service mesh-ready apps using Docker Desktop and Meshery

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Docker

4. 
    Connect Docker with any of your favorite apps in just a few
    clicks. Design, build, and automate anything for your work by
    integrating apps like Docker to create visual automatedcl
    workflows. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns or use
    our no-code designer, MeshMap to connect to apps not yet in our
    library.



5. Scan your kubeconfigs and select your current Kubernetes environment. Switch from one environment to another one.

6. Convert your Docker Compose apps to Kubernetes apps.

7. Meshery Docker Extension extends Docker Desktop’s position as the cloud native developer’s go-to Kubernetes environment with easy access to the next layer of cloud native infrastructure: service meshes.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. From the convenience of your Docker Desktop interface, connect Meshery with your Kubernetes cluster. Watch as MeshSync discovers all of your Kuberentes clusters. Visually design your Docker-based infrastructure. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns using Meshery Catalog. Use our no-code designer, MeshMap, to collaboratively design and operate your infra.

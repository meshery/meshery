<p>
The newrelic-kubernetes-operator is a Kubernetes Operator that facilitates management of New Relic resources from within your Kubernetes configuration. Managing New Relic resources via custom Kubernetes objects can be done the same way you manage built-in Kubernetes objects.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
</p>

    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.

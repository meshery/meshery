<p>
A Kubernetes custom controller whose goal is to serve the installation and lifecycle management of Intel device plugins for Kubernetes.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.

### Overview & Features:
1. Enables Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory (AAD).

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Azure Active Directory (AAD)

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Use Azure Active Directory pod-managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service.

6. A maximum of 200 pod-managed identities are allowed for a cluster.

7. Pod-managed identities are available on Linux node pools only.

8. Federate with any external identity provider

9. Azure AD workload identity authentication method replaces pod-managed identity, which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.

### Overview & Features:
1. Cloud Native Control Planes

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Crossplane

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Highly extensible backend that enables you to orchestrate applications and infrastructure no matter where they run.

6. Highly configurable frontend that lets you define the declarative API it offers.

7. Provides reliability and security features like Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to orchestrate everything - not just containers.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.

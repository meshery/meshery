2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kubeflow Katib

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Drag-n-drop cloud native infrastructure designer to configure, model, and deploy your workloads.

6. Invite anyone to review and make changes to your private designs.

7. Ongoing synchronization of Kubernetes configuration and changes across any number of clusters.

### Overview & Features:
1. CDK8s lets you define Kubernetes apps and components using familiar programming languages and object-oriented APIs.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Cdk For Kubernetes (Cdk8S)

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Defines Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages.

6. Simplify application workflows.

7. Compose and share reusable components through code libraries.

8. Deploy through GitOps

9. cdk8s is an open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs. cdk8s apps synthesize into standard Kubernetes manifests which can be applied to any Kubernetes cluster.

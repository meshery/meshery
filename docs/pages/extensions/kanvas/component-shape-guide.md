## Component Shape Guide

Inside Kanvas, the allocation of specific shapes to signify various purposes creates a coherent and intelligible visual representation of intricate designs.
Currently, the circle is used as the default shape for new components. However, if users or contributors have alternative shapes they believe better suit a particular component, they are encouraged to propose them.

Although the usage of the components is divided into categories, some shapes serve as a universal representation of particular components.

Below are all the shapes with their current usage in a general context.

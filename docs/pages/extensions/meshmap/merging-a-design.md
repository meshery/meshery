Treat other designs as templates or building blocks and combine your designs with others and power-up your designs.

Meshery's Design merge feature provides a practical solution for infrastructure engineers seeking to seamlessly integrate changes across different infrastructure configurations. This functionality proves invaluable in collaborative projects where version control and efficiency are paramount.

### Key Benefits:

- Efficient Collaboration: Simplify collaboration by seamlessly integrating changes using Meshery's composition model. This ensures a smoother workflow for you, the infrastructure and application teams merging designs in shared workspaces or non-shared workspaces.
- Explicit Version Control: Mitigate versioning challenges by combining two or more designs into a single design. This feature allows you to avoid repeating yourself (and you configuration), reducing the risk of conflicting configuration practices by ensuring that everyone is working with the latest - and more importantly - the same infrastructure configuration.
- Time-Saving with Merge Conflicts: Expedite the review of merge conflicts by in your infrastructure code. Streamlines the process, by visualizing your infrastructure designs making the process of reconciliation straightforward.
- Consistency Across Environments: Maintain consistency across different environments. Designs and their reuse enables the transfer of configuration from one Meshery Workspace to another while preserving the original infrastructure configuration, ensuring uniformity in deployment.
- Facilitate Iteration: Improve your iterative infrastructure development process. Design reviews with built-in, inline commenting facilitates the incorporation of feedback and updates seamlessly, empowering you to refine your infrastructure configuration efficiently.


### How to merge Meshery Designs

**Step 1: Access the Extensions UI**


_Note: To merge a design you must be the author of the design._


**Step 2: Navigate to the Designs Tab and Select your Design**


Once you have accessed the Extension's UI, navigate to the Designs tab. In this tab you can see all your designs with their "<b>Name</b>" and "<b>Date Modified</b>". From the designs table, you can click or drag and drop your design onto the canvas.

**Step 3: Drag another Design on the canvas**

To merge a design with other design, drag another design on top of your design from the table to the canvas. It will open a merge modal.

**Step 4: You are all set to merge Designs**

Click <b>Merge</b> to confirm the merge operation.

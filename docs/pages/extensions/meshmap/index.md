MeshMap is a GitOps-infused cloud native **visual designer** for Kubernetes and cloud native applications. MeshMap works with your Kubernetes clusters so that you design and manage your infrastructure and applications between members of your team. MeshMap has two modes: [Designer](https://meshery.io/cloud-native-management/meshmap/design) and [Visualizer](https://meshery.io/cloud-native-management/meshmap/visualize). Create and share your own Kubernetes deployments and patterns in MeshMap Designer. Deploy your designs and manage your infrastructure using MeshMap Visualizer. It includes multi-user collaboration features that allow teams to work together seamlessly towards achieving their goals in a more timely manner. MeshMap aims at removing all the challenging aspects of collaboration from the equation so that everyone on your team can be on the same page when it comes to managing cloud-native infrastructure projects.

### MeshMap For GitOps

MeshMap is a valuable GitOps tool for DevOps teams as it allows them to configure, and manage infrastructure resources. This enables streamlining the process of deploying and undeploying large resources and reduces the time and effort required to set up and maintain environments. Additionally, MeshMap provides features such as visualization, collaboration, and snapshots, which can make cloud native business faster. MeshMap also helps DevOps teams maintain a high level of control, and governance by providing a way to define and manage their infrastructure as code. This reduces human error by overcoming the traditional way of configuring YAMLs and ensures compliance with best practices and industry standards.

### MeshMap For Developers

For developers, MeshMap is valuable as it enables them to manage their infrastructure in an effortless manner. This allows developers to concentrate on coding and delivering features instead of infrastructure management. Furthermore, MeshMap offers efficient management of multiple Kubernetes clusters and manifests, guaranteeing consistency and up-to-dateness across development, staging, and production environments. This minimizes the potential for errors, workloads, and inconsistencies in the configurations, as it detects clusters automatically. This ensures the infrastructure is always available.

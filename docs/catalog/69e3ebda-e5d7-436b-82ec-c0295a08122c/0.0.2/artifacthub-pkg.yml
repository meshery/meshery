description: |-
    This design pattern outlines a comprehensive, production-grade architecture for deploying and managing microservices on Microsoft Azure. It leverages Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the container orchestrator and integrates Istio as a service mesh to provide advanced traffic management, mTLS security, and deep observability.

    The architecture includes a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for automated builds and deployments, with Azure Container Registry (ACR) for immutable image storage. A full observability stack is provisioned with Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. For stateful workloads, the design utilizes Azure Database for MySQL for persistence and Redis for high-performance caching.

readme: "- **Cost:** This architecture utilizes several managed Azure services (AKS, ACR, Azure DB for MySQL) which will incur costs. Review the pricing for each service and configure tiers appropriate for your workload.\n- **Configuration:** Component configurations (e.g., Jenkins pipelines, Istio traffic policies, Prometheus scrape targets) are placeholders and must be tailored to your specific application's needs.\n- **Secrets Management:** Secrets (database credentials, registry keys, etc.) should be managed securely using a solution like Azure Key Vault integrated with AKS, rather than being hardcoded.\n- **Resource Requirements:** Running the full Istio control plane, Jenkins, and a Prometheus/Grafana stack requires a moderately sized Kubernetes cluster. Ensure your AKS node pools have sufficient CPU and memory resources. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

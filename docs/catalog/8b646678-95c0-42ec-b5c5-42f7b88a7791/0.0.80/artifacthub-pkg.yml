description: A Kubernetes-native log processing pipeline using the Fluent Bit Operator. This design routes logs from an application pod through Fluent Bit components—input, filter, parser, and output—to a logging backend. The operator-driven architecture demonstrates observability and clean infrastructure configuration using CRDs.

readme: "This design was created using Meshery Playground, so it hasn’t been deployed or tested on a live Kubernetes cluster yet. To actually run this in a cluster, you’ll need the Fluent Bit Operator installed and running — since the components used (like input, filter, parser, etc.) are CRDs managed by the operator \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

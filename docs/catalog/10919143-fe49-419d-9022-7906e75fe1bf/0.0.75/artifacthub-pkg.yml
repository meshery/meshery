    Architecture design for ClickHouse with OpenTelemetry Collector, HyperDX, and MongoDB.

    - OTLP (HTTP/gRPC) data is ingested by OpenTelemetry Collector.
    - Collector exports telemetry to ClickHouse.
    - HyperDX queries ClickHouse for analytics.
    - MongoDB is used by HyperDX to maintain application state.

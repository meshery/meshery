description: "robot-shop is a sample microservices application designed as a sandbox for learning containerized application orchestration and monitoring techniques.\n\nMain features & components:\n\n- Multiple microservices built using a variety of languages / frameworks: Node.js (Express), Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), Go, PHP (Apache) \n\n- Uses multiple data stores & middleware: MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, RabbitMQ \n\n- Frontend (web) service using AngularJS  \n\n- Nginx for web serving / reverse proxy \n\n\n- Observability / monitoring / tracing support: services expose Prometheus metrics (e.g. cart/payment), Instana agent for tracing & metrics. \n\n\n- Includes load generation utility (load-gen) (using Locust) for simulating traffic / testing performance. \n\n\n- Supports being run via Docker Compose locally, or deployed to Kubernetes (using Helm Chart) \n"

readme: "- Error handling is patchy and there is not any security built into the application.\n- Load generation is not automatic; it needs to be triggered manually or via provided load generator utilities.\n- This sample microservice application has been built using these technologies: NodeJS (Express), Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), Golang, PHP (Apache), MongoDB, Redis, MySQL (Maxmind data), RabbitMQ, Nginx, AngularJS (1.x)\n- AngularJS (1.x) is an older frontend framework; some libraries / dependencies may be deprecated.\n\n\n \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

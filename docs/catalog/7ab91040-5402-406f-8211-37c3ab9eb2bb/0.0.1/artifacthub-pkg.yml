description: This YAML configuration defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the prometheus-adapter, a component of the kube-prometheus stack within the monitoring namespace. The deployment manages two replicas of the prometheus-adapter pod to ensure high availability. Each pod runs a container using the prometheus-adapter image from the Kubernetes registry, configured with various command-line arguments to specify settings like the configuration file path, metrics re-list interval, and Prometheus URL.

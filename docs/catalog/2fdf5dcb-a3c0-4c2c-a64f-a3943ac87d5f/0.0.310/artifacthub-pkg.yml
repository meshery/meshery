    This design incorporates all the key relationships, including the following:



    1.  Hierarchical-Parent-Inventory: This represents a parent-child relationship where the configuration of a parent component influences the child component.



    2.  Hierarchical-Parent-Wallet: In this relationship, one component (the "wallet") serves as a container or host for another, similar to a parent-child structure.



    3.  **Hierarchical-Sibling-MatchLabels:** A Match-Labels Relationship links components based on shared labels, indicating they are siblings that operate together.



    4.  Edge-Mount: An Edge-Mount Relationship represents the assignment of persistent storage to a workload via a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).



    5.  Edge-Permission: The Edge-Permission Relationship defines how components connect to establish access control, where bindings link subjects (like users or services) to roles with specific permissions.



    6.  Edge-Firewall: An Edge-Firewall Relationship models a network policy that controls ingress and egress traffic between components.



    7.  Edge-Network: An Edge-Network Relationship represents the networking configuration between components, typically illustrated by a service providing a stable endpoint for a deployment.



    8.  Edge-Annotation: An Annotation Relationship is a visual indicator used to show a connection between two components without assigning any functional, semantic meaning to that relationship.



    9.  Edge-Reference: An Edge-Reference Relationship represents a logical link where one component refers to another by its name or identifier. It enables interaction by declaring intent, such as a Pod referencing a ConfigMap for its configuration data.

    ELKK (ELK + Kafka) logging pipeline: My App emits logs → Kafka Producer publishes to Kafka topic logs → Kafka brokers the stream (9092) → Logstash consumes from Kafka and indexes into Elasticsearch (index pattern app-logs-*, port 9200) → Kibana queries Elasticsearch for visualisation (5601).
    This Meshery Design captures the topology and intent; some nodes use generic workload placeholders where native models were not available.

readme: "Design is topology-focused; some components (Kafka Producer, Logstash, Kibana) are represented as generic workloads/Namespaces.\nProvides a Logstash pipeline that consumes from Kafka and outputs to Elasticsearch.\nUpdate hostnames/ports for your environment (e.g., kafka:9092, elasticsearch:9200).\nSecurity/auth not configured (no TLS/SASL for Kafka, no X-Pack auth for ES/Kibana).\nIntended for a single-namespace demo; scaling and production hardening are out of scope. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

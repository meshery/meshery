description: "This design incorporates all the key relationships, including the following:\n\n1. Hierarchical-Parent-Inventory: This represents a parent-child relationship between components, where one component is a dependency of another.\n\n2. Hierarchical-Parent-Wallet: In a hierarchical-parent-wallet relationship, one component (the \"wallet\") serves as a container or host for another component, similar to a parent-child structure.\n\n3. Hierarchical-Sibling-MatchLabels: A Match-Labels Relationship in Meshery refers to the configuration where Kubernetes components are linked based on shared labels.\n\n4. Edge-Binding-Mount: An Edge-Mount Relationship in Meshery represents the assignment of persistent storage to Pods via PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC). \n\n5. Edge-Binding-Permission: The Edge-Binding-Permissions Relationship defines how components connect to establish access control and permissions in a system. In the Edge-Binding-Permissions relationship, the binding components, such as role bindings and cluster role bindings, act as essential links that establish and enforce permissions. \n\n6. Edge-Binding-Firewall: An Edge-Firewall Relationship in Meshery models a Kubernetes Network Policy that controls ingress and egress traffic between Pods.\n\n7.  Edge-Non-Binding-Network: An Edge-Network Relationship in Meshery represents the networking configuration between Kubernetes components, typically illustrated by a dashed arrow connecting a Service to a Deployment.\n\n8. Edge-Non-Binding-Annotation: Annotation Relationships refer to a visual representation used to indicate a relationship between two components without assigning any semantic meaning to that relationship."

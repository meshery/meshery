description: 'This YAML manifest defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the Thanos Operator, named "thanos-operator," with one replica. The deployment''s pod template is labeled "app: thanos-operator" and includes security settings to run as a non-root user with specific user (1000) and group (2000) IDs. The main container, also named "thanos-operator," uses the "thanos-io/thanos:latest" image, runs with minimal privileges, and starts with the argument "--log.level=info." It listens on port 8080 for HTTP traffic and has liveness and readiness probes set to check the "/metrics" endpoint. Resource requests and limits are defined for CPU and memory. Additionally, the pod is scheduled on Linux nodes with specific node affinity rules and tolerations for certain node taints, ensuring appropriate node placement and scheduling.'

readme: "1. Security Context:\n\n1.1 The runAsUser: 1000 and fsGroup: 2000 settings are essential for running the container with non-root privileges. Ensure that these user IDs are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions within your environment.\n\n1.2 Dropping all capabilities (drop: - ALL) enhances security but may limit certain functionalities. Verify that the Thanos container does not require any additional capabilities.\n\n2. Image Tag:\n\nThe image tag is set to \"latest,\" which can introduce instability since it pulls the most recent image version that might not be thoroughly tested. Consider specifying a specific, stable version tag for better control over updates and rollbacks.\n\n3. Resource Requests and Limits:\n\nThe defined resource requests and limits (memory: \"64Mi\"/\"128Mi\", cpu: \"250m\"/\"500m\") might need adjustment based on the actual workload and performance characteristics of the Thanos Operator in your environment. Monitor resource usage and tweak these settings accordingly to prevent resource starvation or over-provisioning. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

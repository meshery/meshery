readme: "This design requires careful management of load balancing and database scaling to prevent performance bottlenecks. Network latency, cost optimization, and secure access configurations must be monitored. Regular backups, efficient S3 storage management, and instance right-sizing are essential for reliability and cost control. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

    The design showcases the operational dynamics of the Edge-Permission relationship. To engage with its functionality, adhere to the sequential steps below:
    1. Duplicate this design by cloning it.
    2. Modify the name of the service account.
    Upon completion, you'll notice that the connection visually represented by the edge vanishes, and the ClusterRoleBinding (CRB) is disassociated from both the ClusterRole (CR) and Service Account (SA).
    To restore this relationship, you can either,
    1. Drag the CRB from the CR to the SA, then release the mouse click. This action triggers the recreation of the relationship, as the relationship constraints get satisfied.
    2. Or, revert the name of the SA. This automatically recreates the relationship, as the relationship constraints get satisfied.

    These are a few of the ways to experience this relationship.

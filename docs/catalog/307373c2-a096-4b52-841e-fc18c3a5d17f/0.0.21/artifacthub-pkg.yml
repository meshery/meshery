    This desgin shows you how to build and deploy a simple (not production ready), multi-tier web application using Kubernetes and Docker. This example consists of the following components:

    1. A single-instance Redis to store guestbook entries
    2. Multiple web frontend instances


    **Creating the Redis leader Service**

    The guestbook application needs to communicate to the Redis to write its data. You need to apply a Service to proxy the traffic to the Redis Pod. A Service defines a policy to access the Pods.

    **Set up Redis followers**
    Although the Redis leader is a single Pod, you can make it highly available and meet traffic demands by adding a few Redis followers, or replicas.

    **Creating the Redis follower service**
    The guestbook application needs to communicate with the Redis followers to read data. To make the Redis followers discoverable, you must set up another Service.

readme: "Administrators must carefully manage Service Account token lifecycles to avoid disruptions in Pod functionality caused by expired tokens. Additionally, strict adherence to least privilege principles is essential when assigning permissions to Service Accounts, as overly permissive tokens can increase the attack surface and compromise cluster security. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

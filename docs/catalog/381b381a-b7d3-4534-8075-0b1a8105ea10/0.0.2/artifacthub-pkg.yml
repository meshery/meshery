description: ms-base is a reusable Helm chart for containerized microservices on Kubernetes. It provisions a Deployment and Service and optionally ConfigMaps/Secrets, HPA, and Ingress. Common knobs are exposed via values.yaml (image repo/tag, replicas, resources, env, service.type, ingress.*). Suitable as a starting point for REST/GRPC services; follows 12-factor conventions and ships with health probes and configurable Pod labels/annotations.

readme: "Kubernetes ≥1.22 recommended. If ingress.enabled=true, an ingress controller must be present. If hpa.enabled=true, metrics-server must be installed. Default Service type is ClusterIP; set NodePort/LoadBalancer as needed. Some fields are immutable across upgrades (e.g., Service type, probe ports); changing them may require a rollout or resource recreate. Resource requests/limits in defaults are conservative—tune for prod. Do not commit secrets in values.yaml; prefer Kubernetes Secrets or an external secrets manager. If persistence is enabled, a default StorageClass must exist. RBAC/ServiceAccount can be created; cluster roles are not required by default. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

    This design represents a minimal full-stack web application architecture.

    Client Browser → sends requests to the application.

    Nginx (port 80) → acts as a reverse proxy, serving the frontend and forwarding API requests.

    Node.js Backend (port 3000) → handles application logic and API endpoints.

    Redis (port 6379) → used as an in-memory database/cache for fast data access, session storage, or queue management.

readme: "No persistent database is included (Redis is in-memory, so data is lost if the service restarts).\n\nSecurity (HTTPS/TLS, authentication, and authorization) is not configured yet.\n\nScaling is single-instance; no load balancing or replication is set up.\n\nMonitoring/Logging tools (like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) are not included.\n\nFrontend is assumed to be static files served by Nginx — if a modern React/Angular app is needed, a separate build process may be required. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

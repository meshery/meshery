description: |
    This design demonstrates a microservices-based architecture built using Spring Cloud components. It includes an API Gateway, Service Registry (Eureka), five independent services, three databases, and a Kafka broker for asynchronous communication. The architecture models service discovery, inter-service communication via HTTP, and event-driven messaging through Kafka.

readme: "Some components such as Eureka Server and Kafka are represented using generic service and message broker models due to unavailability of Spring-specific models in Meshery Kanvas. Each service is annotated as a Spring Boot microservice with discovery enabled.\n \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

description: My journey with the Meshery project began as a self-directed learning exercise. By recreating the 'All Relationships' design, I gained practical, hands-on experience with the visual designer and a deeper understanding of core cloud-native concepts. This initial contribution has motivated me to move from learning to building, and I am now eager to contribute more substantially to the project. I am passionate about the Layer5 community and committed to using my skills to help build a great product."

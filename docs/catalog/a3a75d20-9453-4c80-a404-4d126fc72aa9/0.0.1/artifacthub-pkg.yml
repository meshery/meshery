readme: "Persistent Storage: This design requires a Persistent Volume to store the database and user-uploaded content. Ensure a Storage Class is available in your cluster for dynamic provisioning.\nAdmin Credentials: The admin username and password are automatically generated in a Kubernetes Secret upon first deployment. You will need to retrieve these from the secret to log in for the first time.\nProduction Database: For production use, it is highly recommended to use an external, managed database instead of the default one deployed by the chart. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

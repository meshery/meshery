description: A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 1 template for Kanvas that provides a starter layout for creating DFD Level 1 architecture diagrams. It decomposes high-level processes into detailed sub-processes, showing how data moves between external entities, processes, and data stores. Ideal for system architects, developers, and teams documenting data movement across services in cloud native environments.

  ## DFD Level 1 Architecture Template

  This template provides a ready-to-use Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 1 layout for Kanvas. A DFD Level 1 decomposes the single process from a Context Diagram (Level 0) into its major sub-processes, data stores, and external entities, along with the data flows connecting them.

  ### What This Template Includes
  - **External Entities**: User, Admin, Third-Party API (rectangles at the edges)
  - **Processes**: Authentication Service (1.0), Request Processing (2.0), Data Transformation (3.0), Notification Service (4.0) (rounded rectangles)
  - **Data Stores**: User Database (D1), Application Data Store (D2), Log Store (D3) (double-bordered rectangles)
  - **Data Flows**: Login Credentials, Auth Token, API Request, Transformed Data, Notification Alert, Config Updates (dashed labels)
  - **Annotated Comments**: Guide and step-by-step instructions for creating a DFD Level 1

  ### Caveats and Considerations
  - This template uses annotation components (TextBox, Comment) and is intended as a visual diagramming starter.
  - Modify the placeholder labels and text to match your specific system architecture.
  - For complex DFDs, consider linking multiple designs to represent different subsystem decompositions.
  - Ensure every process has at least one input and one output data flow for completeness.

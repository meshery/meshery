Hello, I'm Abie Anders. I'm currently pursuing my B.E in Computer Science and and interning at ABEX group. I'm looking forward to working with this warm community.

Right now, I'm getting into both open-source and cloud at the same time so meshery seems like the perfect fit for me.

I've built applications using programming languages like Go, C++, Python etc. and using frameworks like React.js, Next.js, Fiber and Django.

I love making design choices in projects and really look forward to learning about how cloud infrastructure is designed and managed using tools like meshery.

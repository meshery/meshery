Hi, I’m Kunal — a Computer Science student at VIT Chennai with a focus on Data Science.

I'm currently leading blockchain efforts at GDG VIT Chennai, where I help build decentralized apps and run sessions on smart contract development. I’ve also participated in several hackathons with the GDG team, building on Ethereum and Solana.

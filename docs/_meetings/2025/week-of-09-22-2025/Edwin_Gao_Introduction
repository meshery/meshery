Hi everyone! My name is Edwin Gao, and I’m excited to be joining this community. I’m currently a Computer Science student at the University of Rochester and have had the chance to work on internships where I built software that supports lots of users at scale. Beyond the technical side, I really enjoy collaborating with others, learning new perspectives, and contributing to projects that make an impact. Outside of coding, you can usually find me exploring new places to eat, playing with design ideas, or diving into a good book. Looking forward to meeting you all!

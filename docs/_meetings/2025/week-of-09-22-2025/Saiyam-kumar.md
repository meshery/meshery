Hi Meshery community! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Saiyam Kumar Arora, an 18-year-old full-stack developer based in Bengaluru, India. Currently, I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Data Analytics at IIT Patna and working as the Co-Founder & CTO at Aasta, as well as an SDE Intern at CybraneX. I love building scalable web applications, exploring open-source projects, and contributing to innovative tech communities.

I'm excited to join Meshery, collaborate with fellow contributors, and learn from this vibrant open-source ecosystem. Feel free to connect with me!

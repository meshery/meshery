I'm Ekas, a B.Tech IT student at NIT Jalandhar  with a passion for fast-paced, innovative environments. I'm actively exploring paid internship or full-time opportunities that align with a startup mindset, as I believe my skills are a strong fit.

My backend skills were demonstrated by identifying vulnerabilities in my college's placement and hostel websites, gaining admin access (details: [00:00] https://youtube.com/watch?v=cbRzNTwz10U) and cheating my way in to book me and my homies rooms. Had to delete that video of hostel due to hostel administration.

 My experience includes:

Microsoft: Interned on a RAG-based automated static analysis system, resolving 90+ null pointer dereferences and 85+ memory leaks.

Prava Payments: Developed US remote AI-agentic Shopify APIs, managed AWS infrastructure with Terraform/Docker, and built an AI payments Chrome extension.

Open Food Facts: Contributed to streamlining CI/CD pipelines and improving infrastructure.

Highlights of my achievements:

Hackathons Won : HackTU 6.0, Electothon 7.0, Hack CBS 7.0

Projects: Built Drishti Assessment Platform (4,500+ users), and developed personal projects like Dhaniverse, DevMux, and ZingGuru.

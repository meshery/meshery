Name : Lakshay Pareek
About : I’m currently an LFDT mentee with experience in Golang and consensus algorithms (mainly from working on Hyperledger Fabric).
I’m interested in contributing to Meshery, particularly via backend and Golang-focused tasks, and am keen to learn more about Kubernetes as I go.
Looking forward to working with you all, learning from the community, and making open source contributions!

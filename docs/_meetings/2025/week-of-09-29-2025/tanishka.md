Hi, I am Tanishka. I recently completed Code4GovTech's dedicated mentorship program where I interned as an open-source developer. Lee reached out to me via linkedin and after exploring further with his guidance, I found meshery to be worth contributing to.
So yeah, really excited to continue my open source journey with meshery.

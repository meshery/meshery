I’ve been working on the Meshery adapter template—using Go for the backend, React (with shadcn/ui) for the UI, Docker for packaging, and mesheryctl to install it locally. 
I cloned the repo, built and ran the demo adapter, submitted a README fix plus a new /health endpoint, and I’m excited to contribute more using this stack.

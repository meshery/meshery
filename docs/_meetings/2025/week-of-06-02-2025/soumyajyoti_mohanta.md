Past Experience in Software Development
OneIITP: OneIITP is the official mobile application for IIT Patna students, catering to over 1,200 active users. Built using React Native, Firebase, and Microsoft-based authentication, the app provides essential student services, including a live bus schedule, blogs, class timetable, attendance tracker, institute marketplace, upcoming events, dynamic quick links, emergency contacts, and food outlet information. Additionally, an admin mode enables the streamlined management of content and features. My contributions to this project include designing and developing the blog page, resolving iOS-specific issues to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, and implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Xcode Cloud, significantly improving deployment efficiency and app stability.

Pull Request # 357:added more data in appwrite and firebase setup script: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/359 : This pull request enhances the setup scripts by adding more comprehensive sample data. The existing scripts included only minimal data, which made it challenging to test or demonstrate application features effectively. This change ensures that developers have access to a richer dataset during setup, improving the development and testing experience.
Pull Request # 357: Mobile post screen improved Ui: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/357 : Redesigned the New Post page to provide a cleaner, more intuitive user experience inspired by Instagram’s post creation flow. Improvements include a modern layout, better visual hierarchy, responsive design, and enhanced usability for image selection, preview, and uploading.
Pull Request # 350: Scan monuments improved Ui: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/350 : This PR modernizes the Scan Monuments screen with a cleaner layout, refined spacing, and improved visual hierarchy. It aligns the screen’s design with the overall app for a more intuitive and consistent user experience. Key upgrades include enhanced styling, better element alignment, and responsive adjustments for various screen sizes.
Pull Request # 335: Fixed overflow problem in mobile view of settings page: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/335 : Fixed the mobile view overflow issue on the Settings page by removing hardcoded values from the settings_view_mobile modal and wrapping the main content of the update profile screen page in a SingleChildScrollView. This ensures the layout is responsive to different device widths and allows vertical scrolling, preventing overflow and preserving usability on smaller screens.
Pull Request # 296: mobile view of discover page search bar fixed: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/296 : changed the overlay to listview builder in mobile discover page to have a more consistent user experience, previously both mobile view and desktop view of the app shared overlay screen to show new users, but at some devices width it caused in consistency and thus a bad experience
Pull Request # 291: I placed a comment section in the Discover page and made it responsive: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/291 : I updated the discover page for desktop view by making aesthetic and UI enhancements. Previously, there was a non-functional comment button, which was only operational on mobile devices. To improve user engagement, I added a functional comment text box in the desktop view to better utilize the available space. Additionally, the design is now responsive, accommodating various aspect ratios and widths for a seamless experience.
Pull Request # 286: Migrate Social features from Firebase to Appwrite: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/286 : This PR migrates all social features from Firebase to Appwrite, enhancing scalability and maintainability. It includes user interaction features like comments, likes/unlikes, and check-ins with geolocation, all managed via Appwrite’s Database. Engagement features include real-time push notifications for likes, comments, and follows. Social connectivity is improved with follow/unfollow functionality, storing relationships in a dedicated Appwrite collection. Users can search for others by name, username, or attributes using Appwrite’s querying capabilities. Content management supports creating, editing, and retrieving posts with media (images and videos) stored in Appwrite’s Storage service. This transition optimises data handling and security while ensuring a seamless user experience.
Pull Request # 243: fix the alert dialog issue in desktop view: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/243 : I previously encountered an issue where I was unable to select the "Cancel" and "Check-In" options in the alert box that appeared after clicking the check-in button in Monument View. The alert box was too small, leading to an overflow issue that prevented access to these options. I am pleased to report that this issue has now been resolved, and now any user can successfully check in using my current location.
Pull Request # 241: Doc/faq: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/241 : The FAQ(frequently asked questions) document provides solutions to common setup and debugging issues across platforms (macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, Web), helping new contributors quickly resolve hurdles. It includes environment setup instructions, real-world troubleshooting experiences, and resolutions for platform-specific errors like macOS keychain issues or JDK-Gradle compatibility problems. It also differentiates debugging production-specific vs. browser-specific issues. By standardising issue reporting and providing clear resolutions, this document enhances project maintainability and accelerates onboarding. Ultimately, it encourages broader contributions by reducing friction for developers on different platforms.
Pull Request # 233: Fix/wrong password indication: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/233 : This PR addresses an issue where entering a wrong password in the desktop view of the app does not display a visual indication of the error. This fix adds proper error handling and a clear visual indication to inform users when they have entered an incorrect password.
Pull Request # 206: Fix/desktop login screen: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/206 : changed scaffold to single child scroll view to account for edge cases where the component shown in screen is bigger than the screen size where the user is unable to access the component in screen
Pull Request # 204: Fix/incorrect navigation bar on tab size view: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/204 : This PR fixes issues with the navigation bar and monument detail view when resizing the app on Desktop to a mobile-like screen size. It ensures a consistent design layout for web and large-screen devices, preventing random layout size increases that cause overflow and cut-off components. Updates in lib/main.dart handle display changes dynamically, while monument_details_view_desktop.dart now properly renders on Desktop. Adjustments to local_experts_card.dart ensure it remains visible across different screen sizes without disappearing in constrained spaces. This resolves the problem where the monument detail view defaulted to a mobile layout on Desktop, ensuring smooth functionality and a responsive UI.
Pull Request # 199: Fixed scaffold with navigation, which was causing the logout button to vanish in tablet mode: https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento/pull/291 : This PR fixes the issue where the logout button was missing when the app was used on tablets or devices with widths between 451 and 800, including resizable window apps. A logout button has been added for this range and is logically linked to Firebase Authenticator to ensure proper user logout when clicked. This resolves the problem, allowing users on tablets and specified resolutions to log out seamlessly without any hassle

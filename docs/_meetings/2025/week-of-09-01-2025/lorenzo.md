Hey, I am Lorenzo Croce, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Padua, Italy. I joined this meeting to get to know more about contributing to open source, as I’m really interested in web development (both frontend and backend). I’m currently getting into open source through the Linux Foundation Mentorship Program and have already started my first issue on the [Layer5 website](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/6757), improving the SEO of a page.

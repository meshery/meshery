**Meshery follows schema-driven development.** As a project, Meshery has different types of schemas. Some schemas are external facing, and some internal to Meshery itself. The [`meshery/schemas`](https://github.com/meshery/schemas) repository serves as a central location for storing schemas from which all Meshery components can take reference. See [Contributing to Schemas]({{site.baseurl}}/project/contributing/contributing-schemas) for details.

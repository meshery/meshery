<h2>What is the Meshery Registry</h2>

The Meshery Registry is a vital component within Meshery, serving as a centralized repository for managing a diverse range of cloud and cloud native resources. It stores and organizes crucial information such as models, categories, components, and relationships, enabling efficient interaction and utilization of these resources within the Meshery ecosystem. You can conveniently access and manage registry data through Meshery UI, and through Meshery CLI (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reference/mesheryctl/#meshery-registry-management">mesheryctl registry</a>).

Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each service mesh is not equally capable as the other.\n\nAdapters have a set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types. See the extensibility page for more details on adapter operations.\n\nHow can I create a new adapter?\nSee the extensibility documentation for details on how new Meshery adapters are made.\n\nCan I run more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter?\nThe default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the meshery-istio adapter. To do so, modify ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml to include multiple copies of the given adapter.\n\nSee the “Multiple Adapters” guide for more information."

The DCO is a simple statement that you,\nas a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.\n\nSee the DCO file for the full text of what you must agree to\nand how it works here.\nTo signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your\ngit commit messages:\n\nSigned-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>\n\n\nIn most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the\n-s or --signoff flag to git commit. You must use your real name and a reachable email\naddress (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:\n$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”\n\n\nTo ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global .gitconfig:\n\n~/.gitconfig\n[alias]\n  amend = commit -s --amend\n  cm = commit -s -m\n  commit = commit -s\n\nOr you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:\n\n\n\nDocumentation Contribution Flow\nPlease contribute! Meshery documentation uses GitHub Pages to host the docs site. Learn more about Meshery’s documentation framework. The process of contributing follows this flow:\n\n\n  Create a fork, if you have not already, by following the steps described here\n  In the local copy of your fork, navigate to the docs folder.\ncd docs\n  Create and checkout a new branch to make changes within\ngit checkout -b <my-changes>\n  Edit/add documentation.\nvi <specific page>.md\n  Run site locally to preview changes.\nmake site\n  Commit, sign-off, and push changes to your remote branch.\ngit push origin <my-changes>\n  Open a pull request (in your web browser) against our main repo: https://github.com/layer5io/meshery.\n\n\nMeshery Contribution Flow\nMeshery is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. UI is built on React and Next.js. To make building and packaging easier a Makefile is included in the main repository folder.\n\nRelevant coding style guidelines are the Go Code Review Comments and the Formatting and style section of Peter Bourgon’s Go: Best \nPractices for Production Environments.\n\nPlease note: All make commands should be run in a terminal from within the Meshery’s main folder.\n\nPrerequisites for building Meshery in your development environment:\n\n  Go version 1.11+ installed if you want to build and/or make changes to the existing code.\n  GOPATH environment variable should be configured appropriately\n  npm and node should be installed your machine, preferably the latest versions.\n  Fork this repository (git clone https://github.com/layer5io/meshery.git), clone your forked version of Meshery to your local, preferably outside GOPATH. If you happen to checkout Meshery inside your GOPATH and you have version of Go prior to version 1.13, please set an environment variable GO111MODULE=on to enable GO Modules.\n\n\nBuild and run Meshery server\nTo build & run the Meshery server code, run the following command:\nmake run-local\n\n\nAny time changes are made to the GO code, you will have to stop the server and run the above command again.\nOnce the Meshery server is up and running, you should be able to access Meshery on your localhost on port 9081 at http://localhost:9081. One thing to note, you might NOT see the Meshery UI until the UI code is built as well.\nAfter running Meshery server, you will need to select your Cloud Provider by navigating to localhost:9081. Only then you will be able to use the Meshery UI on port 3000.\n\nBuilding Docker image\nTo build a Docker image of Meshery, please ensure you have Docker installed to be able to build the image. Now, run the following command to build the Docker image:\nmake docker\n\n\nWriting a Meshery Adapter\nMeshery uses adapters to provision and interact with different service meshes. Follow these instructions to create a new adapter or modify and existing adapter.\n\n\n  Get the proto buf spec file from Meshery repo:\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layer5io/meshery/master/meshes/meshops.proto\n  Generate code\n    \n      Using Go as an example, do the following:\n        \n          adding GOPATH to PATH: export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin\n          install grpc: go get -u google.golang.org/grpc\n          install protoc plugin for go: go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go\n          Generate Go code: protoc -I meshes/ meshes/meshops.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:./meshes/\n        \n      \n      For other languages, please refer to gRPC.io for language-specific guides.\n    \n  \n  Implement the service methods and expose the gRPC server on a port of your choice (e.g. 10000).\n\n\nTip: The Meshery adapter for Istio is a good reference adapter to use as an example of a Meshery adapter written in Go.\n\nUI Contribution Flow\nMeshery is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. UI is built on React and Next.js. To make building and packaging easier a Makefile is included in the main repository folder.\n\nInstall UI dependencies\nTo install/update the UI dependencies:\nmake setup-ui-libs\n\n\nBuild and export UI\nTo build and export the UI code:\nmake build-ui\n\n\nNow that the UI code is built, Meshery UI will be available at http://localhost:9081.\nAny time changes are made to the UI code, the above code will have to run to rebuild the UI.\n\nUI Development Server\nIf you want to work on the UI, it will be a good idea to use the included UI development server. You can run the UI development server by running the following command:\nmake run-ui-dev\n\n\nMake sure to have Meshery server configured, up and running on the default port http://localhost:9081 before proceeding to access and work on the UI server at http://localhost:3000.\nAny UI changes made now will automatically be recompiled and served in the browser.\n\nRunning Meshery from IDE\nIf you want to run Meshery from IDE like Goland, VSCode. set below environment variable\nSAAS_BASE_URL=https://meshery.layer5.io\nPORT=9081\nDEBUG=true\nADAPTER_URLS=mesherylocal.layer5.io:10000 mesherylocal.layer5.io:10001 mesherylocal.layer5.io:10002 mesherylocal.layer5.io:10003 mesherylocal.layer5.io:10004\n\ngo tool argument\n-tags draft\n\nupdate /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1 mesherylocal.layer5.io"

						"content": "Extending Meshery\n\nMeshery provides several extension points for working with different service meshes, load generators and providers. Meshery also offers a REST API.\n\nGuiding Principles for Extensibility\n\nThe following principles are upheld in the design of Meshery’s extensibility.\n\n\n  Recognize that different deployment environments have different systems to integrate with.\n  Offer a default experience that provides the optimal user experience.\n\n\nExtension Points\n\nMeshery is not just an application. It is a set of microservices where the central component is itself called Meshery. The following points of extension are currently incorporated into Meshery.\n\nTypes of Extension Points:\n\n\n  Providers\n  Load Generators\n  Adapters\n  REST API\n\n\nProviders\n\nMeshery interfaces with Providers through a Go interface. The Provider implementations have to be placed in the code and compiled together today. A Provider instance will have to be injected into Meshery when the program starts.\n\n\n\nEventually, Meshery will keep the implementation of Providers separate so that they are brought in through a separate process and injected into Meshery at runtime (OR) change the way the code works to make the Providers invoke Meshery.\n\nProviders as an object have the following attributes:\n\n{\n id: aower2-1234xd-1234 [guid] \t# future consideration\n type: local, [ local | remote ]\n display-name: \"None\", [ string ]\n description: \"Default Provider\n   - feature 1 \n   - feature 2\", [ multi-line string ] \n capabilities: [ \t\t\t# future consideration\n    {featureName:\"perf_results\", present: true}, \n    {featureName:\"two_factor_auth\", present: true}\n   ]\n}\n\n\nWhat functionality do Providers perform?\n\n  Authentication and Authorization\n  Examples: session management, two factor authentication, LDAP integration\n  Long-Term Persistence\n  Storage and retrieval of performance test results\n  Storage and retrieval of user preferences\n\n\nTypes of providers\nTwo types of providers are defined in Meshery: local and remote.\n\nRemote Providers\nName: “Meshery” (default)\n\n  Authentication and Authorization\n  Results long term persistence\n  Save environment setup\n  Retrieve performance test results\n  Free to use\n\n\nLocal Provider\nName: “None”\n\n  No Authentication\n  Local storage of results. Mainly ephemeral.\n  Environment setup not saved.\n  No performance test result history.\n  Free to use.\n\n\nMeshery provides the ability for you as a service mesh manager to customize your service mesh deployment.\n\nLoad Generators\nUsers may prefer to use one load generator over the next given the difference of capabilities between load generators, so Meshery provides a load generator interface (a gRPC interface) behind which a load generator can be implemented. Meshery provides users with choice of which load generator they prefer to use for a given performance test. Users may set their configure their own preference of load generator different that the default load generator.\n\nWhat function do load generators in Meshery provide?\nLoad generators will provide the capability to run load tests from Meshery. As of today the load generators are embedded as libraries in Meshery and Meshery invokes the load generators APIs with the right load test options to run the load test. At the moment, Meshery has support for HTTP load generators. Support for GRPC and TCP load testing is on the roadmap. Meshery has functional integration with fortio and wrk2.\n\nWhy support multiple load generators?\nDifferent use cases and different opinions call for different approaches to statistical analysis of the performance results. For example, wrk2 accounts for a concept called Coordinated Omission.\n\nWhich are currently supported?\n\n  fortio - Fortio load testing library, command line tool, advanced echo server and web UI in go (golang). Allows to specify a set query-per-second load and record latency histograms and other useful stats.\n  wrk2 - A constant throughput, correct latency recording variant of wrk.\n  nighthawk (coming soon!) - Enables users to run distributed performance tests to better mimic real-world, distributed systems scenarios.\n\n\nService Mesh Adapters\nWhat are Meshery adapters?\nAdapters allow Meshery to interface with the different service meshes. See a list of all available service mesh adapters.\n\nAdapter Capabilities\nMeshery communicates with adapters over grpc. Adapters establish communication with the service mesh. Adapters have a predefined set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types.\n\nThe predefined operation types are:\n\n  Install\n  Sample application\n  Config\n  Validate\n  Custom\n\n\nHow to create new adapter?\n\nMeshery uses adapters to provision and interact with different service meshes. Follow these instructions to create a new adapter or modify and existing adapter.\n\nSee the CONTRIBUTING.md for additional information and specific steps.\n\nTip: The Meshery adapter for Istio is a good reference adapter to use as an example of a Meshery adapter written in Go.\n\nREST API\nMeshery provides a REST API available through the default port of 9081/tcp.\n\nAuthentication\nRequests to any of the API endpoints must be authenticated and include a valid JWT access token in the HTTP headers.\nType of authentication is determined by the selected Provider.\n\nAuthorization\nCurrently, Meshery only requires a valid token in order to allow clients to invoke its APIs.\n\nEndpoints\nEach of the API endpoints are exposed through server.go.\nEndpoints are grouped by function (e.g. /api/mesh or /api/perf)."

Use either of the following two methods to prepare a compatible kubeconfig file.\n\nAutomatic Configuration (Recommended)\n\n\n  In your browser, navigate to Meshery (e.g., http://localhost:9081) and login.\n  Download your Meshery authentication token by clicking Get Token under your user profile.\n  Use this authentication token to execute the following command:\n     $ mesheryctl system config gke --token <PATH TO TOKEN>\n    \n  \n\n\nThis command updates your kubeconfig to provide Meshery with access to your managed Kubernetes instance.\nOnce configured, proceed with using Meshery (mesheryctl system start).\n\nManual Configuration (Optional)\n\nIf the Automatic Configuration procedure fails or you would like to manually prepare your kubeconfig file to provide Meshery with the necessary access to your managed Kubernetes instance, perform the following actions:\n\n\n  Download the generate_kubeconfig_gke.sh shell script.\n  Execute this shell script identifying ServiceAccount name and Namespace arguments, like so:\n     ./generate_kubeconfig_gke.sh cluster-admin-sa-gke default\n    \n  \n  Once the script is complete, you may proceed to start Meshery with the GKE-compatible configuration by executing:\n     $ mesheryctl system start\n    \n  \n  In your browser, navigate to Meshery (e.g., http://localhost:9081) and login.\n  Under Settings–>Environment, provide the generated file (config-cluster-admin-sa-gke-default.yaml)as the kubeconfig file.\n\n\nMeshery should now connect with your managed Kubernetes instance.

You can set the KIUBECONFIG environment command below:\nexport KUBECONFIG=${HOME}/.kube/config\n\nUse the command below check the connection of the cluster and make sure the cluster you connected what’s the cluster was created by KinD:\nkubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind\n\n\nTo delete your cluster use:\nkind delete cluster --name kind\n\n\n\nUsing Helm\n\nHelm v3\n\nWe strongly recommend to use Helm v3, because of the version not included the Tiller(https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-preview-pt2/#helm) component anymore. It’s more light and safe.\n\nRun the following:\n$ git clone https://github.com/layer5io/meshery.git; cd meshery\n$ kubectl create namespace meshery\n$ helm install meshery --namespace meshery install/kubernetes/helm/meshery\n\n\n\n  NodePort - If your cluster does not have an Ingress Controller or a load balancer, then use NodePort to expose Meshery and that can be modify under the chart values.yaml:\n\n\nservice:\n  type: NodePort\n  port: 8080\n  annotations: {}"

See compatibility table for version compatibility. To install Meshery on your cluster, clone the Meshery repo:\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/layer5io/meshery.git; cd meshery\n\n\nCreate a namespace as a new logical space to host Meshery and its components:\n\n$ kubectl create ns meshery\n\n\nAll the needed deployment yamls for deploying Meshery are included in the install/deployment_yamls/k8s folder inside the cloned Meshery folder. To deploy the yamls on the cluster please run the following command:\n\n$ kubectl -n meshery apply -f install/deployment_yamls/k8s\n\n\nOnce the yaml files are deployed, we need to expose the meshery service to be able to access the service from outside the cluster. There are several ways a service can be exposed on Kubernetes. Here we will describe 3 common ways we can expose a service:\n\n\n  Ingress - If your Kubernetes cluster has a functional Ingress Controller, then you can configure an ingress to expose Meshery:\n\n\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\nname: meshery-ingress\nannotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"\nspec:\nrules:\n- host: *\n    http:\n    paths:\n    - path: /\n        backend:\n        serviceName: meshery-service\n        servicePort: 8080\n\n\n  LoadBalancer - If your Kubernetes cluster has an external load balancer, this might be a logical route.\n  NodePort - If your cluster does not have an Ingress Controller or a load balancer, then use NodePort to expose Meshery:\n    apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nspec:\n  type: NodePort"

To modify the default configuration, find ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml on your system. ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml is a Docker Compose file.\n\nConfiguration: Running fewer Meshery adapters\nIn the ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml configuration file, remove the entry(ies) of the adapter(s) you are removing from your deployment.\n\nConfiguration: Running more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter\n\nThe default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the meshery-istio adapter. To do so, modify ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml to include multiple copies of the given adapter.\n\nDemo of Meshery managing service mesh deployments across multiple clusters:\n\n\n\nSee on YouTube: Cloud Native Austin Virtual Meetup: April 2020"

						"content": "Introducing Meshery\nThe service mesh management plane adopting, operating and developing on different service meshes. \nMeshery facilitates learning about functionality and performance of service meshes and incorporates the collection and display of metrics from applications running on or across service meshes.\nMeshery provides this high-level functionality:\n\n\n  Service Mesh Performance Management\n  Service Mesh Configuration Management\n    \n      Configuration best practices\n    \n  \n  Service Mesh Lifecycle Management\n  Service Mesh Interoperability and Federation\n\n\n\n\nDelivered at Service Mesh Day 2019\n\nWhat challenges does Meshery solve?\nService mesh management - one or multiple service meshes.\n\nAnytime performance questions are to be answered, they are subjective to the specific workload and infrastructure used for measurement. Given this challenge, the Envoy project, for example, refuses to publish performance data because such tests can be:\n\n  Involved\n  Misinterpreted\n\n\nBeyond the need for performance and overhead data under a permutation of different workloads (applications) and types and sizes of infrastructure resources, the need for cross-project, apple-to-apple comparisons are also desired in order to facilitate a comparison of behavioral differences between service meshes and selection of their use. Individual projects shy from publishing test results of other, competing service meshes. An independent, unbiased, credible analysis is needed.\n\nMeshery is intended to be a vendor and project-neutral utility for uniformly benchmarking the performance of service meshes. Between service mesh and proxy projects (and surprisingly, within a single project), a number of different tools and results exist. Meshery allows you to pick an efficient set of tools for your ecosystem by providing performance evaluation and metrics.\n\n\n  By leveraging Meshery you could achieve apples-to-apples performance comparison of service meshes\n  Track your service mesh performance from release to release.\n  Understand behavioral differences between service meshes.\n  Track your application performance from version to version.\n\n\nMeshery is for Adopters and Operators\nWhether making a Day 0 adoption choice or maintaining a Day 2 deployment, Meshery has useful capabilities in either circumstance. Targeted audience for Meshery project would be any technology operators that leverage service mesh in their ecosystem; this includes developers, devops engineers, decision makers, architects, and organizations that rely on microservices platform.\n\nMeshery is for performance management: testing and benchmarking\nMeshery helps users weigh the value of their service mesh deployment against the overhead incurred in running a service mesh. Meshery provides statistical analysis of the request latency and throughput seen across various permutations of your workload, infrastructure and service mesh configuration.\nIn addition to request latency and throughput, Meshery also tracks memory and CPU overhead in of the nodes in your cluster. Measure your data plane and control plane against different sets of workloads and infrastructures.\n\n\nEstablish a performance benchmark and track performance against this baseline as your environment changes over time.\n\nMeshery is for any service mesh\nInfrastructure diversity is a reality for any enterprise. Whether you’re running a single service mesh or multiple types of service meshes, you’ll find that Meshery supports your infrastructure diversity (or lack thereof).\n\n\n  Available service mesh adapters - Service mesh adapters that Meshery currently supports.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Platform                                              \n      Status\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Consul\n      stable\n    \n    \n      Meshery Adapter for Istio\n      stable\n    \n    \n      Linkerd\n      stable\n    \n    \n      Network Service Mesh\n      stable\n    \n    \n      Octarine\n      stable\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  In-progress service mesh adapters - Service mesh adapters for which community-contributed support has been committed and are currently under development.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Platform                                              \n      Status\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Citrix Service Mesh\n      beta\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  Help-wanted service mesh adapters - Service mesh adapters adapters for which we are seeking community-contributed support.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Platform                                                  \n      Status\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      App Mesh\n      alpha\n    \n    \n      Kuma\n      alpha\n    \n    \n      Maesh\n      alpha\n    \n    \n      Tanzu SM\n      alpha\n    \n  \n\n\nCommunity\nThis project is community-built and welcomes collaboration!

Other benchmark tools are not. There are some other tools used for service mesh benchmarking, like regpatrol. Regpatrol is used by IBM is not open source or available in binary form to use and has the following differences from Meshery:\n\n  Telemetry - regpatrol sources telemetry from the Mixer Prometheus adapter and uses IBM’s proprietary node agent.\n  Meshery sources from the Mixer Prometheus adapter and uses Prometheus node-exporter.\n  Traffic type - regpatrol uses jmeter, which can parse responses and perform functional tests.\n  Meshery is using fortio, which is for load-gen and perf-testing only.\n\n\nResources\n\nMeshery Presentations\n\n\n  O’Reilly OSCON 2020\n  O’Reilly Infrastructure & Ops 2020\n  InnoTech Dallas 2020\n  KubeCon EU 2020\n  DockerCon 2020 (deck, video)\n  Open Source 101 at Home\n  Docker Captains Roundtable 2020\n  Cloud Native Austin 2020\n  NSMCon 2019 talk (video, deck)\n  Service Mesh Day 2019\n  DockerCon 2019 Open Source Summit\n  KubeCon EU 2019 (video, deck)\n  KubeCon EU 2019 Istio Founders Meetup\n  Cloud Native Rejekts EU 2019\n  Container World 2019\n  Solving the Service Mesh Adopter’s Dilemma (deck, event,video)\n\n\nOther Resources\n\n  Service Mesh Comparison\n  Service Mesh Tools\n  Service Mesh Books\n  Service Mesh Workshops"

Users may set their configure their own preference of load generator different that the default load generator.\n\nNode and Service Mesh Metrics\n\nMeshery provides performance test results alongside environment metrics, including service mesh control and data plane metrics as well as cluster node resource metrics, so that operators may easily understand the overhead of their service mesh’s control plane and data plane in context of the overhead incurred on nodes within the cluster.\n\nGrafana and Meshery\n\nConnect Meshery to your existing Grafana instance and Meshery will import the boards of your choosing.\n\n\n    \n\n\nConnecting to Grafana\nIf you have an API key configured to restrict access to your Grafana boards, you will need to enter the API key when establishing Meshery’s connection to Grafana.\n\n\n  Importing Grafana boards\n    \n      Importing existing Grafana boards via API\n      Importing custom Grafana board via yaml\n    \n  \n  Configuring graph panel preferences\n\n\nPrometheus and Meshery\nMeshery allows users to connect to one or more Prometheus instances in order to gather telemetric data (in the form of metrics). These metrics may pertain to service meshes, Kubernetes, applications on the mesh or really… any metric that Prometheus has collected.\n\nOnce you have connected Meshery to your Prometheus deployment(s), you may perform ad-hoc connectivity tests to verify communication between Meshery and Prometheus.\n\nSuggested Reading\n\n\n  Guide: Interpreting Performance Test Results"

						"content": "# Reporting a vulnerability\nWe are very grateful to the security researchers and users that report\nback Meshery security vulnerabilities. We investigate every report thoroughly.\n\nTo make a report, send an email to the private\n[meshery-security-vulns-reports@layer5.io](mailto:meshery-security-vulns-reports@layer5.io)\nmailing list with the vulnerability details. For normal product bugs\nunrelated to latent security vulnerabilities, please head to\nthe appropriate repository and submit a [new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/issues).\n\n### When to report a security vulnerability?\n\nSend us a report whenever you:\n\n- Think Meshery has a potential security vulnerability.\n- Are unsure whether or how a vulnerability affects Meshery.\n- Think a vulnerability is present in another project that Meshery\ndepends on (Docker for example).\n\n### When not to report a security vulnerability?\n\nDon't send a vulnerability report if:\n\n- You need help tuning Meshery components for security.\n- You need help applying security related updates.\n- Your issue is not security related.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe Meshery team acknowledges and analyzes each vulnerability report within 10 working days.\n\nAny vulnerability information you share with the Meshery team stays\nwithin the Meshery project. We don't disseminate the information to other\nprojects. We only share the information as needed to fix the issue.\n\nWe keep the reporter updated as the status of the security issue is addressed.\n\n## Fixing the issue\n\nOnce a security vulnerability has been fully characterized, a fix is developed by the Meshery team.\nThe development and testing for the fix happens in a private GitHub repository in order to prevent\npremature disclosure of the vulnerability.\n\n## Early disclosure\n\nThe Meshery project maintains a mailing list for private early disclosure of security vulnerabilities. \nThe list is used to provide actionable information to close Meshery partners. The list is not intended \nfor individuals to find out about security issues.\n\n## Public disclosure\n\nOn the day chosen for public disclosure, a sequence of activities takes place as quickly as possible:\n\n- Changes are merged from the private GitHub repository holding the fix into the appropriate set of public\nbranches.\n\n- Meshery team ensures all necessary binaries are promptly built and published.\n\n- Once the binaries are available, an announcement is sent out on the following channels:\n\n    - The [Meshery blog](/blog)\n    - The [Meshery Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/mesherio)\n    - The #announcements channel on Slack\n\nAs much as possible this announcement will be actionable, and include any mitigating steps customers can take prior to\nupgrading to a fixed version."

[Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install)\n```Powershell\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform\nRestart-Computer\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n```\n\nNote: setting the default to version to 2 will avoid doing it for every distro created\n\n### 2. [Install a new distro](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice)\nIn this how-to, Ubuntu 18.04 will be the distro used, but feel free to use another distro.\n\n### 3. Install Docker Engine, CLI and Compose\nThe first components required are Docker Engine, Docker CLI (command line interface) and Docker Compose.\n\n[Docker Engine and CLI](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc\nsudo apt-get install -y \\\n    apt-transport-https \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    curl \\\n    gnupg-agent \\\n    software-properties-common\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo add-apt-repository \\\n   \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n   $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n   stable\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\nsudo service docker start\nsudo usermod -aG $USER\n```\n\n[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n```bash\nsudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n```\n\n### 4. Install a Kubernetes cluster\nOnce Docker is installed, the next step will be to install a Kubernetes cluster.\nIn this how-to, [K3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d) will be used as it relys only on Docker.\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/master/install.sh | bash\nk3d create\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\n```\n\n### 5. Finish up\n\nFollow the rest of Meshery [installation](../installation) steps."

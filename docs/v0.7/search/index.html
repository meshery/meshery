Meshery was created as an extensible platform to serve a broad set of modern application management needs.\n\n\n\n    \n    Question: What does Meshery do?\n\n\nAnswer: Collaborative infrastructure management. Meshery enables you to design and operate cloud native infrastructure visually, collaboratively, with confidence, and in partnership with your teammates.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Question: Is Meshery an open source project?\n\nAnswer: Yes, Meshery is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project and is licensed under Apache v2. As an internal developer platform, Meshery is highly extensible, offering multiple forms of extension points within which users and partners can customize and extend Meshery's functionality.\n\n\n\n    \nQuestion: Why should I use Meshery?\n\nAnswer: Meshery is a powerful tool for managing ​Kubernetes infrastructure. It seamlessly integrates with different hundreds of tools and offers extensibility through many different extension points. With Meshery, you can easily discover your environment, collaboratively manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, connect your Git and Helm repos, and analyze app and infra performance.\n\n\nUser FAQs\n\n\n    \n    Question: What is mesheryctl?\n\nAnswer: A command line interface to manage Meshery. `mesheryctl` can manage any number of Meshery deployments.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How do I install Meshery?\n\nAnswer: Meshery runs on a number of platforms. You are encouraged to use mesheryctl to configure and control Meshery deployments. Install `mesheryctl` using any of these options:\n\n\nBash user\nBrew user\nScoop user\nDirect download\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Question: Does Meshery require Kubernetes to manage infrastructure?\n\nAnswer: While Meshery's configuration and lifecycle management features require Kubernetes to operate, you don't need to run your infrastructure on Kubernetes. Meshery can:\n\nPerform load generation and performance analysis independent of Kubernetes\nConfigure and manage non-Kubernetes infrastructure (like AWS and GCP services)\nUse Kubernetes operators to manage Cloud services outside of Kubernetes (e.g. AWS EC2)\n\nSee supported cloud integrations for more details.\n\n\n\nQuestion: What architecture does Meshery have?\nAnswer: An extensible architecture. There are several components, languages and they have different purposes. See Meshery's Architecture.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between make server and mesheryctl system start? Do they both run Meshery on my local machine?\n\nAnswer: Yes, both of them do run Meshery on your local machine. `make server` builds Meshery from source and runs it on your local OS, while `mesheryctl system start` runs Meshery as a set of containers in Docker or in Kubernetes on your local machine.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What systems can I deploy Meshery onto?\n\nAnswer: Many. See Meshery's Compatibility Matrix.\n\n\n\nQuestion: What systems does Meshery manage?\nAnswer: Many. See Meshery's Integrations\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why is Meshery Server only receiving MeshSync updates from one of my Kubernetes Clusters?\nAnswer: In order to receive MeshSync updates, Meshery Server subscribes for updates Meshery Broker. In other words, Meshery Server connects to the `meshery-broker` service port in order to subscribe for streaming MeshSync updates. By default, the Meshery Broker service is deployed as type Kubernetes Service type LoadBalancer, which requires that your Kubernetes cluster provides an external IP address to the Meshery Broker service, exposing it external to the Kubernetes cluster.\nIf you're running Kubernetes in Docker Desktop, an external IP address of localhost is assigned. If you're running Minikube, and execute minikube tunnel to gain access to Meshery Broker's service, you will find that both Meshery Broker service endpoints (from two different clusters) are sharing the same localhost:4222 address and port number. This port sharing causes conflict and Meshery Server is only able to connect to one of the Meshery Brokers.\n\nFew ways to solve this problem:\n\n\nUse an external cloud provider which provides you with the LoadBalancer having an external IP address other than localhost.\nUse Kind cluster with MetalLB configuration\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why does the dashboard not show the infrastructure provisioned or discovered by Meshery?\nAnswer: This issue is typically caused by either lack of connectivity between Meshery Server and Meshery Broker or by database corruption. Use the following troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:\n\nLack of Connectivity\n\n\nConfirm that the Meshery Broker service is exposed from your cluster using kubectl get svc -n meshery and that an hostname or IP address is displayed in the External Address column. Meshery Server should be able to reach this address.\nIt is possible that MeshSync is not healthy and not sending cluster updates, check for MeshSync status by navigating to Settings in Meshery UI and clicking on the MeshSync connection.\nIf MeshSync is healthy, check the status of Meshery Broker by clicking on the NATS connection.\n\n\nIf either is the case, Meshery Operator will make sure MeshSync and Meshery Broker deployments are again healthy, wait for some time, otherwise try redeploying Meshery Operator.\n\nDatabase Corruption\n\nIf MeshSync, Meshery Broker and Meshery Operator are healthy, then perhaps, there is corruption in the Meshery Database. Use the following troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:\n\nTry clearing the database by clicking on the `Flush MeshSync` button associated with the corresponding cluster.\nIf you don't see the specific entities in Meshery UI, you may choose to reset Meshery's database. This option is in the Reset System Tab in Settings page.\n\n\nNote: You can also verify health of your system using mesheryctl system check\n\n\n\nContributing FAQs\n\n\n\nQuestion: Getting an error while running make server on Windows?\nAnswer: On Windows, set up the project on Ubuntu WSL2 and you will be able to run the Meshery UI and the server. For more information please visit Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows.\n\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\nDon't find an answer to your question here? Ask on the Discussion Forum."

						"content": "## Guiding Principles of Adapter Design\n\nAdapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure. Review the list of all available [Meshery Adapters](../concepts/architecture/adapters). See the [Meshery Architecture](../concepts/architecture/architecture.md) diagrams for visuals on how adapters relate to other Meshery components.\n\nMeshery upholds the following guiding principles for adapter design:\n\n1. **Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure, exposing their differentiated value to users.**\n  - Cloud native infrastructure projects should be encouraged to maintain their own adapters. Allowing them to expose their differentiated capabilities encourages this.\n1. **Adapters should avoid wheel reinvention, but seek to leverage the functionality provided by cloud native infrastructure under management.**\n  - This both reduces sustaining costs and improves reliability.\n\n## Adapters\n\n| Adapter | Earliest Version |\n| :----------: | :--------------: |\n{% for adapter in site.adapters -%}\n{% if adapter.port -%}\n|  [{{ adapter.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ adapter.url }}) |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {{ adapter.earliest_version }} |\n{% endif -%}\n{% endfor %}\n\n### Adapter Capabilities\n\nMeshery communicates with adapters over gRPC. Adapters establish communication with the cloud native infrastructure. Adapters have a predefined set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types.\n\nThe predefined operation types are:\n\n- Install\n- Sample application\n- Config\n- Validate\n- Custom\n\n## Meshery Adapter Codebase Overview\n\n[Common libraries](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uQU7e_evJ8IMIzlLoBi3jQSRvpKsl_-K1COVGjJVs30/edit#) are used to avoid code duplication and apply DRY.\n\n### [MeshKit](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit)\n\nThe code hierarchy is pluggable and independent from one another. There can be N number of packages depending upon the use case.\n- `errors/` - holds the implementations and the error handlers and error codes which are used across projects.\n- `logger/` - holds the implementations of logging handler and custom attributes to add if any.\n- `utils/` - holds all the utility functions that are specific to meshery projects and are to be used generically across all of them.\n- `tracing/` - holds the implementations of tracing handlers with different tracing providers like jaeger,newrelic, etc.\n\nEach package inside a meshkit is a handler interface implementation, the implementation could be from any third-party packages or the go-kit.\n\n### [Meshery Adapter Library](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-adapter-library)\n\nThis section contains a high level overview of the meshery-adapter-library, its purpose and architecture. For details, the reader is referred to the documentation and the code in the repository.\n\nThe main purpose of the meshery-adapter-library is to:\n- provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.\n- implement common cross cutting concerns like logging, errors, and tracing\n- provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and - operations implemented in the adapters.\n- provide middleware extension points\n\n[![Meshery Adapter Library]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/adapters/meshery-adapter-library.svg\n)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/adapters/meshery-adapter-library.svg)\n\n_Figure: Displaying Meshery Adapter library architecture along with an example of integration_\n\n#### Overview and Usage\n\nThe library consists of interfaces and default implementations for the main and common functionality of an adapter. It also provides a mini-framework that runs the gRPC adapter service, calling the functions of handlers injected by the adapter code. This is represented in an UML-ish style in the figure below. The library is used in all of Meshery's adapters."

						"content": "## What are Meshery Adapters?\n\nPart of Meshery's extensibility as a platform, Meshery Adapters are purpopse-built to address an area in need of management that is either considered optional to the platform and/or is considered an area in which additional depth of control is needed. Adapters extend Meshery's management capabilities in any number of ways, including lifecycle, configuration, performance, governance, identity and so on. Meshery Adapters come in different form factors, and depending on their purpose, deliver different sets or capabilities. Each Adapter registers its capabilities with Meshery Server. Meshery Server, in-turn, exposes those capabilities for you to control.\n\n## Meshery Adapters for Lifecycle Management\n\nAdapters that extend Meshery's lifecycle management capabilities for infrastructure do so, by offering an infrastructure-specific interface to increase the depth of control that Meshery has over a particular technology. Meshery uses adapters to offer choice of load generator (for performance management) and for managing different layers of your infrastructure. Lifecycle adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure, exposing their differentiated value to users.\n\nMeshery has lifecycle adapters for managing the following cloud native infrastructure.\n{% assign sorted = site.adapters | sort: \"project_status\" | reverse %}\n\n| Adapter Status | Adapter | Port | Earliest Version supported |\n| :------------: | :----------: | :--: | :------------------------: |\n{% for adapter in sorted -%}\n{% if adapter.project_status -%}\n| {{ adapter.project_status }} |  [{{ adapter.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ adapter.url }}) | {{ adapter.port }} | {{adapter.earliest_version}} |\n{% endif -%}\n{% endfor %}\n\n## Meshery Adapters for Performance Management\n\n_v0.8.0 Roadmap:_ The `meshery-nighthawk` adapter externalizes Nighthawk as an Meshery component.\n\nMeshery Server allows users to generate traffic load tests using Nighthawk, fortio, and wrk2. Using the `meshery-nigthhawk` adapter, you can schedule, control, and execute performance tests.\n\nRun the `meshery-nighthawk` adapter as an externalized load generator when you: \n\n1. Need a smaller sized container image for Meshery. Nighthawk binaries are dynamically linked (C++) and they need other dependencies to work. This causes bloat in Meshery Server’s image which doesn’t need them.\n1. Need *adaptive load control* of your performance tests, controlling the variability by which the system under test receives load. Use Meshery Server to run adaptive load tests.\n1. Need *distributed load testing* and the ability to horizontally scale Nighthawk, using Nighthawk’s execution forwarding service and results sink.\n\n## Adapter Deployment and Registration\n\nLike every Meshery component, Meshery Adapters use MeshKit.\n\n### Adapter FAQs\n\n#### Is each Meshery adapter made equal?\n\nNo, different Meshery adapters are written to expose the unique value of each cloud native infrastructure. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each cloud native infrastructure is not equally capable as the other. Each Adapter has a set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types. See the [extensibility]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility) page for more details on adapter operations.\n\n#### How can I create a new adapter?\n\nYes, see the [extensibility]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility) documentation for details how to create a new Meshery Adapter. See the Meshery Adapter Template repository as boilerplate for your new adapter.\n\n#### Do adapters have to be written in Golang?\n\nNo. Adapters much interface with Meshery Server via gRPC. What language is used in that adapter is the prerogative of a given adapter's maintainers.\n\n#### Can I run more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter?\n\nYes. The default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the `meshery-istio` adapter. To do so, modify ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml to include multiple copies of the given adapter.\n\nSee the \"[Multiple Adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/installation/multiple-adapters)\" guide for more information."

Note: It is advisable to Install Meshery in your AKS clusters\n\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall the Meshery command line client, mesheryctl.\nInstall kubectl on your local machine.\nInstall Azure CLI, configured for your environment.\nAccess to an active AKS cluster in one of your resource groups.\n\n\n\nAlso see: Install Meshery on Kubernetes\n\nAvailable Deployment Methods\n\n\n  In-cluster Installation\n    \n      Preflight Checks\n      Preflight: Cluster Connectivity\n      Installation: Using mesheryctl\n      Installation: Using Helm\n      Post-Installation Steps\n    \n  \n\n\nIn-cluster Installation\n\nFollow the steps below to install Meshery in your AKS cluster.\n\nPreflight Checks\n\nRead through the following considerations prior to deploying Meshery on AKS.\n\nPreflight: Cluster Connectivity\n\n\n  Verify you connection to an Azure Kubernetes Services Cluster using Azure CLI.\n  Login to Azure account using az login.\n  After a successful login, identify the subscription associated with your AKS cluster:\n\n\n\n\n az account set --subscription [SUBSCRIPTION_ID] \n\n\n\n  After setting the subscription, set the cluster context.\n\n\n\n\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group [RESOURCE_GROUP] --name [AKS_SERVICE_NAME]\n\n\n\nInstallation: Using mesheryctl\n\nUse Meshery’s CLI to streamline your connection to your AKS cluster. Configure Meshery to connect to your AKS cluster by executing:\n\n\n\n$ mesheryctl system config aks\n\n\n\nOnce configured, execute the following command to start Meshery.\n\n\n\n$ mesheryctl system start\n\n\n\nIf you encounter any authentication issues, you can use mesheryctl system login. For more information, click here to learn more.\n\nInstallation: Using Helm\n\nFor detailed instructions on installing Meshery using Helm V3, please refer to the Helm Installation guide.\n\nPost-Installation Steps\n\nOptionally, you can verify the health of your Meshery deployment, using mesheryctl system check.\n\nYou’re ready to use Meshery! Open your browser and navigate to the Meshery UI.\n\nAccessing Meshery UI\n\nAfter successfully deploying Meshery, you can access Meshery’s web-based user interface. Your default browser will be automatically opened and directed to Meshery UI (default location is http://localhost:9081).\n\nYou can use the following command to open Meshery UI in your default browser:\n\n\n\n$ mesheryctl system dashboard \n\n\n\nIf you have installed Meshery on Kubernetes or a remote host, you can access Meshery UI by exposing it as a Kubernetes service or by port forwarding to Meshery UI.\n\n\n\n$ mesheryctl system dashboard --port-forward \n\n\n\nDepending upon how you have networking configured in Kubernetes, alternatively, you can use kubectl to port forward to Meshery UI.\n\n\n\n$ kubectl port-forward svc/meshery 9081:9081 --namespace meshery\n\n\n\nVerify Kubernetes Connection\n\nAfter installing Meshery, regardless of the installation type, it is important to verify that your kubeconfig file has been uploaded correctly via the UI.\n\n\n  In the Meshery UI, navigate to Lifecycle from the menu on the left.\n  Click on Connections.\n  Ensure that your cluster appears in the list of connections and is marked as Connected.\n  Click on the cluster name to perform a ping test and confirm that Meshery can communicate with your cluster.\n\n\n\nCustomizing Your Meshery Provider Callback URL\n\n\n  Meshery Server supports customizing your Meshery Provider authentication flow callback URL. This is helpful when deploying Meshery behind multiple layers of networking infrastructure.\n\n\n\n  For production deployments, it is recommended to access the Meshery UI by setting up a reverse proxy or using a LoadBalancer. By specifying a custom redirect endpoint, you can ensure that authentication flows complete successfully, even when multiple routing layers are involved.\n\n\n\n  Note: For production deployments, it is important to preselect the choice of Remote Provider in order to control which identity providers authorized. Learn more about this in the Extensibility: Providers guide.\n\n\n\n  Define a custom callback URL by setting up the MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL environment variable before installing Meshery.\n\n\n\n  To customize the authentication flow callback URL, use the following command:\n\n\n\n $ MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL=https://custom-host mesheryctl system start\n\n\n\n  Meshery should now be running in your Kubernetes cluster and the Meshery UI should be accessible at the EXTERNAL IP of the meshery service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Discussions with \"meshery\" Tag\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n     Dec 31 | \n     404 page not found\n    \n          by Anuj Kumar Sharma\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Dec 30 | \n     Seeking Help with Playground Features for Complex Designs\n    \n            by Appareddy Dwarampudi\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Dec 04 | \n     Link Meshery Integrations and Github workflow or local code\n    \n                by Shlok Mishra\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 25 | \n     Issue: Unable to Run make server-local in Meshery Cloud Setup Due to Soda CLI Dependency\n    \n                    by Md Kaif Ansari\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 28 | \n     Issue on Setting Up Meshery Using Docker\n    \n                          by Kean Serna\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 22 | \n     Meshery CI Maintainer: Sangram Rath\n    \n                      by Vivek Vishal\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 25 | \n     T.roles_names is undefined ( permission path is not provided )\n    \n                by Shlok Mishra\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 20 | \n     Meshery Development Meeting | Nov 20th 2024\n    \n                      by Vivek Vishal\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 10 | \n     Error in \"make server\" and \"make ui-server\"\n    \n                                by Aadarsh Shekhar\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Nov 11 | \n     Difference in dev Environments on port 9081 and 3000\n    \n                                  by Divyansh Khatri"

The REST and GraphQL APIs are available on the same network port you use to connect to Meshery UI, which is `9081/tcp` by default. Each of the API endpoints are exposed through [server.go](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/server/router/server.go). Endpoints are grouped by function (e.g. `/api/system/version`). Additionally, [Remote Providers](./providers) can extend Meshery's endpoints behind the `/api/extensions/` endpoint.\n\n### API Reference\n\n\n  \n\nREST API\n\n\nGraphQL API\n\n\nMeshery Server's REST API is available at [hostname]:[port]/api/.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"dark\" title=\"Meshery's REST API Reference\" content=\"See REST API Reference Self-generated API documentation for Meshery’s REST API.

Meshery's containers can be deployed to either Docker or Kubernetes. Meshery components connect to one another via gRPC requests. Meshery Server stores the location of the other components and connects with those components as needed. Typically, a connection from Meshery Server to Meshery Adapters is initiated from a client request (usually either `mesheryctl` or Meshery UI) to gather information from the Adapter or invoke an Adapter's operation.\n\n### Adapters\n\nIn Meshery v0.6.0, Adapters will register with Meshery Server over HTTP POST. If Meshery Server is not available, Meshery Adapters will backoff and retry to connect to Meshery Server perpetually.\n\n\n\n\n_Figure: Meshery deploys inside or outside of a Kubernetes cluster_\n\n#### Adapters and Capabilities Registry\n\nEach Meshery Adapter delivers its own unique specific functionality. As such, at time of deployment, the Meshery Adapter will register its cloud native infrastructure-specific capabilities (its operations) with Meshery Server's capability registry.\n\n\n\n\n_Figure: Meshery Adapter Operation Registration_\n\n### Clients\n\nMeshery's REST API may be consumed by any number of clients. Clients need to present valid JWT token.\n\n\n\n\n\n_Figure: Clients use Meshery's [REST API](extensibility/api#rest), [GraphQL API](extensibility/api#graphql), or a combination of both._\n\n### Providers\n\nAs a point of extensibility, Meshery supports two types of [providers](/extensibility/providers): _Local_ and _Remote_.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure: Meshery Provider architecture\n\n\n## Object Model\n\nThis diagram outlines logical constructs within Meshery and their relationships.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure: Meshery Object Model\n\n\n## Meshery Operator and MeshSync\n\nMeshery Operator is the multi-cluster Kubernetes operator that manages MeshSync and Meshery Broker.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure: Meshery Operator and MeshSync\n\n\nSee the [**Operator**]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/operator) section for more information on the function of an operator and [**MeshSync**]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/meshsync) section for more information on the function of meshsync.\n\n## Database\n\nMeshery Server's database is responsible for collecting and centralizing the state of all elements under management, including infrastructure, application, and Meshery's own components. Meshery's database, while persisted to file, is treated as a cache.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure: Meshery Docker Extension\n\n\n_See the [**Database**]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/database) section for more information on the function of the database._\n\n## Meshery Docker Extension \n\nMeshery's Docker extension provides a simple and flexible way to design and operate cloud native infrastructure on top of Kubernetes using Docker containers. The architecture of this extension is designed to be modular and extensible, with each component serving a specific purpose within the overall deployment process.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure: Meshery Docker Extension\n\n\n## Meshery CLI \n\nThe Command Line Interface ( also known as [mesheryctl](/guides/mesheryctl/working-with-mesheryctl) ) that is used to manage Meshery. Use `mesheryctl` to both manage the lifecycle of Meshery itself and to access and invoke any of Meshery's application and cloud native management functions.\n\n\n### **Statefulness in Meshery components**\n\nSome components within Meshery's architecture are concerned with persisting data while others are only\nconcerned with a long-lived configuration, while others have no state at all.\n\n| Components        | Persistence  | Description                                                           |\n| :---------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [mesheryctl](/guides/mesheryctl/working-with-mesheryctl)        | stateless    | command line interface that has a configuration file                  |\n| [Meshery Adapters](/concepts/architecture/adapters)  | stateless    | interface with cloud native infrastructure on a transactional basis                |\n| Meshery Server    | caches state | application cache is stored in `$HOME/.meshery/` folder               |\n| [Meshery Providers](/extensibility/providers) | stateful     | location of persistent user preferences, environment, tests and so on |\n| [Meshery Operator](/concepts/architecture/operator)  | stateless    | operator of Meshery custom controllers, notably MeshSync              |\n| [MeshSync](/concepts/architecture/meshsync)          | stateless    | Kubernetes custom controller, continuously running discovery          |\n\n### **Network Ports**\n\nMeshery uses the following list of network ports to interface with its various components:\n\n{% for adapter in site.adapters -%}\n{% if adapter.port -%}\n{% capture adapter-ports %}\n|  [{{ adapter.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ adapter.url }}) | {{ adapter.port }}/gRPC | Communication with Meshery Server |\n{% endcapture %}\n{% endif -%}\n{% endfor %}\n\n| Component                |   Port   | Purpose                                         |\n| :----------------------- | :------: | :-----------------------------------------------|\n| Meshery Server          | 9081/tcp | UI, REST and GraphQL APIs                           |\n| Meshery Server          | 80/tcp | Websocket                          |\n| [Meshery Broker](/concepts/architecture/broker)           | 4222/tcp | Client communication with Meshery Server        |\n| [Meshery Broker](/concepts/architecture/broker)            | 8222/tcp | HTTP management port for monitoring Meshery Broker.

The scaling is independent of the number of instances running.\n\n#### What does an HA configuration look like?\nWe leverage on the kubernetes functionality in terms of the High-Availability behaviour. Meaning, the broker instance gets instantiated/restarted on its own when an issue occurs. In part, Meshery-Operator is also responsible for keeping the broker functional.\n\n#### What stateful characteristics does the Broker have?\nAll the messages that are published to the broker is persisted in-memory within the broker instance until it get consumed. Persistent-volume/Disk-space is not currently being used by the Broker.\n\n#### How do I know if the Broker is working? How do I troubleshoot the Broker?\nThe Broker instance is deployed inside the kubernetes cluster as a `Statefulset`. In the case where the broker doesn't seem to work, here are a few steps to troubleshoot the instance:\n\n- Make sure the pods corresponding to the `Statefulset` is up and running.\n- Make sure the kubernetes cluster has support for kubernetes `Service` type `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`.\n- Ensure connectivity between the Meshery-Server and the Broker service endpoint."

With Meshery Catalog, you can easily find and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and tools, making it easy to streamline your cloud native development and operations processes. A Catolog is based on the Meshery's [Catalog Schema](https://github.com/meshery/schemas/blob/98560345814e4be036d9f0020759faf3202ec2e4/schemas/constructs/v1alpha1/catalog_data.json) with defined attributes.\n\n### Simplify Your Cloud Native Infrastructure Deployment and Management\n\nMeshery Catalog functions much like a cloud marketplace, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing, discovering, and sharing configurations and patterns for cloud native infrastructure. With Meshery Catalog, you can easily find and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and tools, making it easy to streamline your cloud native development and operations processes.\n\nIt also supports a collaborative environment, where DevOps engineers can share their experiences, feedback, and best practices with others in the community. Import cloud native patterns published by others into your Meshery Server. Benefit from and build upon each pattern by incorporating your own tips and tricks, then publish and share with the community at-large. This facilitates knowledge-sharing and helps to build a strong ecosystem of cloud native infrastructure experts.\n\n\n### To create a design pattern using Meshery UI\n\n1. Navigate to the Meshery UI in your web browser.\n2. Navigate to the configuration section, usually located in the main navigation menu.\n3. Head over to Designs and click on import or create design.\n4. Select the category and Model as per your need and configure the application.\n5. Voilà, You can publish or deploy you design.\n\n### To create design pattern using Meshery CLI\n\n1. Ensure that you have [Meshery CLI](https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl) installed on your machine and it is configured to connect to your desired Meshery instance.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Use the Meshery CLI commands to interact with the catalog. `mesheryctl design`\n4. Follow the prompts or instructions provided by the Meshery CLI help.\n* Apply [design file](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/configuration-management):  `mesheryctl design apply --file [path to design file | URL of the file]`\n* Delete design file:  `mesheryctl design delete --file [path to design file]`\n* View design file:  `mesheryctl design view [design name | ID]`\n* List all designs: `mesheryctl design list`\n5. [Importing](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl#cloud-native-pattern-configuration-and-management) a design. `mesheryctl design import -f [file-path] -s [manifest | compose | helm]`\n6. Applying [WASM Filter](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/configuration-management#wasm-filters). `mesheryctl filter import [file | URL] --wasm-config [filepath|string]`\n\n\n### Publishing a Design to Meshery Catalog\n\n1. **Request to Publish**: The author submits a request to publish their design to the Meshery Catalog, including a description and any relevant considerations.\n2. **Review by Admin**: The workspace owner or admin reviews the design. They have the option to approve, deny, or request changes by commenting on the design.\n3. **Approval Process**:\n    - If the admin or workspace admin **approves** the design, a validation is performed to ensure the design data is accurate. Once validated, the design is published to the catalog.\n    - If the admin **denies** the design, feedback is provided for necessary changes. After the changes are made, the design is automatically published with appropriate versioning.\n4. **Ongoing Management**:\n    - The author or workspace owner retains permission to edit, delete, or unpublish their designs from the catalog at any time.\n5. **Notification for Changes**: If the design no longer adds value to the Meshery Catalog, a prior notification is sent to the author, and the design may be unpublished.\n6. **GitHub Workflow Integration**: Once approved, a GitHub workflow is triggered to publish the design to the Meshery.io Catalog.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure: Workflow to publish a design in catalog\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n    \nQuestion: Why are images invisible for some designs in the Meshery Catalog?\n\nAnswer: In certain instances, the images of published designs in Meshery Catalog may not be visible due to bandwidth issues. This can occur when there are network constraints affecting the retrieval of image data. However, rest assured that the design information and other relevant details are still accessible.\n\n\n{% include alert.html\n    type=\"info\"\n    title=\"Help with Meshery Catalog\"\n    content=\"If you have any questions or need assistance, reach out on the discussion forum.\" %}"

						"content": "Meshery’s build and release system incorporates many tools, organized into different workflows each triggered by different events. Meshery’s build and release system does not run on a schedule, but is event-driven. GitHub Actions are used to define Meshery’s CI workflows. New builds of Meshery and its various components are automatically generated upon push, release, and other similar events, typically in relation to their respective master branches.\n\n\nMeshery Test Documents\n The Meshery Test Strategy (1,2) is a comprehensive document that outlines the approach to testing, types of tests, frameworks used - test strategy - for each of Meshery's architectural components. The Meshery Test Plan is a tactical spreadsheet that *itemizes* specific integration and end-to-end test cases and tracks their status. It includes a list of GitHub workflows and their purpose. Join the Meshery CI meeting and/or the developers mailing list to get involved.\n\n\nArtifacts\n\nToday, Meshery and Meshery adapters are released as Docker container images, available on Docker Hub. Meshery adapters are out-of-process adapters (meaning not compiled into the main Meshery binary), and as such, are independent build artifacts and Helm charts. The Docker images are created and tagged with the git commit SHA, then pushed to Docker Hub automatically using GitHub Actions. Subsequently, when contributions containing content for the Helm charts of Meshery and Meshery Adapter are linted and merged, they will be pushed and released to meshery.io Github page by GitHub Action automatically.\n\nArtifact Repositories\n\nArtifacts produced in the build processes are published and persisted in different public repositories and in different formats.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Location\n      Project\n      Repository\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Docker Hub\n      Meshery\n      https://hub.docker.com/r/meshery/meshery\n    \n    \n      GitHub\n      mesheryctl\n      https://github.com/meshery/meshery/releases\n    \n    \n      Docker Hub\n      Meshery Adapter for &lt;adapter-name&gt;\n      https://hub.docker.com/r/meshery/meshery-&lt;adapter-name&gt;&gt;\n    \n    \n      Docs\n      Meshery Documentation\n      https://docs.meshery.io\n    \n    \n      GitHub\n      Cloud Native Performance\n      https://github.com/service-mesh-performance\n    \n    \n      Github\n      Helm charts\n      https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/tree/master/charts\n    \n  \n\n\nSecrets\n\nSome portions of the workflow require secrets to accomplish their tasks. These secrets are defined within the respective repositories and accessible to workflows during runtime. Currently defined secrets include:\n\n\n  DOCKER_USERNAME: Username of the Docker Hub user with the right privileges to push images\n  DOCKER_PASSWORD: Password for the Docker Hub user\n  GO_VERSION: As of March, 2024 is 1.21\n  IMAGE_NAME: appropriate image name for each of the Docker container images. All are under the layer5io org.\n  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: Used for notification of new GitHub stars given to the Meshery repo.\n  GLOBAL_TOKEN: Used for securely transmitting performance test results for the None Provider.\n  NPM_TOKEN: npm authentication token, used to perform authentication against the npm registry in meshery deployment workflow.\n  GH_ACCESS_TOKEN: GitHub access token for various operations\n  INTEGRATION_SPREADSHEET_CRED: Credentials for integration spreadsheet access\n  MAIL_PASSWORD: Password for email notifications\n  MAIL_USERNAME: Username for email notifications\n  MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN: Token for Meshery provider authentication\n  MESHERY_TOKEN: General Meshery authentication token\n  METAL_AUTH_TOKEN: Authentication token for metal provider\n  METAL_SERVER1: Configuration for metal server 1\n  METAL_SERVER2: Configuration for metal server 2\n  METAL_SERVER3: Configuration for metal server 3\n  NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: Authentication token for Netlify\n  NETLIFY_SITE_ID: Site ID for Netlify deployments\n  PLAYGROUND_CONFIG: Configuration for playground environments\n  PROVIDER_TOKEN: General provider authentication token\n  RELEASEDRAFTER_PAT: Personal access token for Release Drafter\n  RELEASE_NOTES_PAT: Personal access token for release notes generation\n  REMOTE_PROVIDER_USER_EMAIL: Email used for authentication in Playwright tests\n  REMOTE_PROVIDER_USER_PASS: Password used for authentication in Playwright tests\n\n\nThe Docker Hub user, mesheryci, belongs to the “ciusers” team in Docker Hub and acts as the service account under which these automated builds are being pushed. Every time a new Docker Hub repository is created we have to grant “Admin” (in order to update the README in the Docker Hub repository) permissions to the ciusers team.\n\nChecks and Tests\n\nMeshery’s CI workflow incorporates several checks (partial list below) during merges and/or commits to any branches and pull requests to master branch to prevent broken code from being merged into master.\n\nCollectively, Meshery repositories will generally have CI workflow for commits and pull requests that consist of the following actions:\n\n\n  Lint check (golint)\n  Static analysis check (staticcheck)\n  Vet (govet)\n  Security checks (gosec)\n  Unit tests (go tests)\n  Build (go build)\n  Release binaries through GoReleaser (only for mesheryctl in the Meshery repository)\n  Docker build, tag and push\n  Helm charts lint (helm)\n  Helm charts release, tag and push(stefanprodan/helm-gh-pages@master)\n\n\nTests for adapters\n\nAll Meshery adapters use a central workflow that is referenced in each of their test workflows which get triggered every time a pull request is made. These\ntests in adapters are end-to-end tests and use patternfile. The reusable workflow is present in .github/workflows in Meshery repository with the workflow name “Test for Meshery adapters using patternfile”\n\nPre-requisite for referencing this workflow\n\n\n  Using actions/upload-artifact@v2 a patternfile has to be uploaded as an artifact with the name as “patternfile”.\n  The name of the uploaded patterfile should be passed in\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n      patternfile_name: &lt; name of the patternfile which is uploaded &gt;\n\n\n\n  Note: This Job is pre-run to the actual test. This is done in order to create patternfiles dynamically and use them. Therefore name of this jobs has to be passed as\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  needs:\n     &lt; Name of the pre-requisite job &gt;\n\n\n\n  There should be an infinite token passed in: (Or else local provider will be used)\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  secrets:\n    token: $\n\n\nFunctionality of Central Workflow\n\n\n  Checks out the code of the repository(on the ref of latest commit of branch which made the PR) in which it is referenced.\n  Starts a minikube cluster\n  Builds a docker image of the adapter and sets minikube to use docker’s registry.\n  Starts the adapter and Meshery Server (The url to deployment and service yaml of adapter are configurable).\nNOTE: The adapter name has to passed in:\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n     adapter_name: &lt; NAME OF THE ADAPTER &gt;\n\n\n\n  The uploaded patternfile is deployed.\n  Workflow sleeps for some time.\n  Then the assertion is made that the pods passed in-\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n     expected_pods: &lt; pod1,pod2,pod3 &gt;  #comma separated pod names that will be expected to be present after patternfile is deployed\n\n\n\n  And these pods are present in their respective namespaces passed in-\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n     expected_pods_namespaces: &lt; pod1ns, pod2ns , pod3ns &gt;\n\n\nExpected inputs of this workflow\n\n\n\ninputs:\n  expected_pods:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  expected_pods_namespaces:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  service_url:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  deployment_url:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  adapter_name:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  patternfile_name:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  provider:\n    required: false\n    type: string\nsecrets:\n  token:\n\n\nExpected outputs of this workflow\n\nThe pods passed in “expected_pods” are running in the subsequent namespaces passed in “expected_pods_namespaces”. If not, the workflow fails\n\nAutomated Builds\n\nAll Meshery GitHub repositories are configured with GitHub Actions. Everytime a pull request is submitted against the master branch of any repository, that repository’s GitHub Actions will be invoked (whether the PR is merged or not). Workflows defined in Meshery repository will generally (but not always) perform the following actions:\n\n\n  trigger a Docker build to build a Docker container image\n  generate two Docker tags:\n    \n      a tag containing the git merge SHA\n      a tag containing that particular release’s git tag (if one is present)\n    \n  \n  assign each of these two tags to the new container image as well as the latest tag.\n  push the new Docker tags and image to Docker Hub.\n\n\nmesheryctl\n\nAs a special case, the meshery repository contains an additional artifact produced during each build. This artifact is mesheryctl, which is built as an executable binary. In order to make the job of building mesheryctl easier for a combination of different platform architectures and operating systems, we are using GoReleaser. Irrespective of branch, for every git commit and git push to the meshery repository, GoReleaser will execute and generate the OS and arch-specific binaries (but will NOT persist these artifacts in GitHub). Even though mesheryctl binaries are built each time a pull request is merged to master, only stable channel artifacts are published (persisted).\n\nReleasing mesheryctl to GitHub\n\nOnly when a git tag containing a semantic version number is present (is a commit in the master branch) will GoReleaser execute, generate the archives, and also publish the archives to Meshery’s GitHub releases automatically. GoReleaser is configured to generate artifacts for the following OS, ARCH combination:\n\n\n  Darwin - i386, x86_64\n  Linux - i386, x86_64\n  Windows - i386, x86_64\n  FreeBSD - i386, x86_64\n\n\nThe artifacts will be made available as a tar.gz archive for all the operating systems. mesheryctl is bundled into packages for commonly used package managers: homebrew and scoop.\n\nHomebrew\n\nGoReleaser facilitates the creation of a brew formula for mesheryctl. The homebrew-tap repository is the location for mesheryctl’s brew formulas. Releases of mesheryctl are  published in the official homebrew-core tap at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pkgs/container/core%2Fmesheryctl.\n\nScoop\n\nGoReleaser facilitates the creation of a Scoop app for mesheryctl. The scoop-bucket repository is the location of Layer5’s Scoop bucket.\n\nHelm Charts Lint Check, Build, and Release\n\nThe charts lint check, charts build, and charts release workflows are all triggered by GitHub events. Sometimes this event is the opening, updating, or merging of a branch, or sometimes a manual invocation, or a GitHub release event.\n\nCheck Helm Charts\n\nEvery PR which includes changes to the files under install/kubernetes/ directory in the meshery/meshery will trigger a Github Action to check for any mistakes in Helm charts using the helm lint command.\n\nRelease Helm Charts to Github and Artifact Hub\n\nNew Meshery Helm charts are published upon trigger of a release event in the meshery/meshery repo. New versions of Meshery’s Helm charts are published to Meshery’s Helm charts release page. [Artifact Hub] (https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/meshery/meshery) syncs with these updated Meshery Helm charts.\n\nRelease Versioning\n\nMeshery and its components follow the commonly used, semantic versioning for its release numbering scheme. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD, increment the:\n\n\n  MAJOR version - major changes with rare potential for incompatible API changes.\n  MINOR version - add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.\n  PATCH version - mostly for bug and security fixes.\n  AlPHA/BETA/RC - used to facilitate early testing of an upcoming release.\n\n\nComponent Versioning\n\nMeshery comprises a number of components including a server, adapters, UI, and CLI. As an application, Meshery is a composition of these different functional components. While all of Meshery’s components generally deploy as a collective unit (together), each component is versioned independently, so as to allow them to be loosely coupled and iterate on functionality independently. Some of the components must be upgraded simultaneously, while others may be upgraded independently. See Upgrading Meshery for more information.\n\nGitHub release tags will contain a semantic version number. Semantic version numbers will have to be managed manually by tagging a relevant commit in the master branch with a semantic version number (example: v1.2.3).\n\nRelease Process\n\nDocumentation of Meshery releases contains a table of releases and release notes and should be updated with each release.\n\nAutomated Releases\n\nReleases are manually triggered by a member of the release team publishing a release. Release names and release tags need to be assigned by the publishing team member. GitHub Action workflows will trigger and take care of running the required steps and publishing all artifacts (e.g., binary and docker images).\n\nWorkflow Triggers\n\nThe following events will trigger one or more workflows:\n\n\n  Tagged Release\n  Commit pushed to the master branch\n  PR opened or commit pushed to PR branch\n  PR merged to the master branch\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\nWhile use of GitHub Actions facilitates automated builds, ReleaseDrafter is helping with facilitating automated release notes and versioning.\n\nGenerating Release Notes\n\nReleaseDrafter generates a GitHub tag and release draft. ReleaseDrafter action will trigger and will automatically draft release notes according to the configuration set-up. ReleaseDrafter drafts releases as soon as a commit is made into master after the previous release. The GitHub Action, ReleaseDrafter, is compatible with semantic releases and is used to auto-increment the semantic version number by looking at the previous release version.\n\nAutomated Release Notes Publishing\n\nThe publishing of release notes to Meshery Docs is automated. Triggered by a release event, a workflow will checkout the Meshery repo, copy the auto-drafted release notes into a Jekyll collection in Meshery Docs, and generate a pull request.\n\nAutomated Release Notes Sending\n\nThe sending of release notes is now automated as a step in the stable release channel workflow. The release notes are automatically sent to the developers@meshery.io mailing list.\n\nAutomated Pull Request Labeler\n\nA GitHub Issue labeler bot is configured to automatically assign labels to issues based on which files have changed in which directories. For example, a pull request with changes to files in the “/docs/**” folder will receive the “area/docs” label. Presence of the “area/docs” label is used to trigger documentation builds and Netlify builds of the Meshery Docs. Similar labels are assigned and used to trigger workflows or used as conditional flags in workflows to determine which workflows or which steps in a workflows to run.\n\nRelease Channels\n\nArtifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels.\n\nRelative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n\nStable Channel\n\nThe following is an example of the release channels and the docker tags used to differentiate them. The latest tag will be applied only to images in the stable release channel. Here are two releases with two different images.\n\nLatest Stable Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:stable-latest\n  layer5/meshery:stable-v0.4.1\n  layer5/meshery:stable-324vdgb (sha)\n\n\nOlder Stable Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:stable-v0.4.0\n  layer5/meshery:stable-289d02 (sha)\n\n\nEvery docker image built receives either the edge tags or the stable tags. Which set of image tags assigned is determined by whether a release tag is present or not. In other words, stable channel docker images get the “stable” tags only in the presence of a release tag (e.g. v0.4.1).\n\nEdge Channel\n\nThe Edge release channel provides early access to the latest features, allowing experimentation and feedback. Recent updates introduce dynamic versioning for Edge releases and improve compatibility with remote providers, ensuring a seamless experience. This makes the Edge channel valuable for users seeking cutting-edge features while contributing to the Meshery project. Docker image tags remain consistent for differentiation.\n\nStable and edge releases are both published to the same Docker Hub repository. Docker Hub repositories differentiate release channels by image tag. The following Docker images tagging convention is followed:\n\nLatest Edge Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:edge-latest\n  layer5/meshery:edge-289d02 (sha)\n\n\nOlder Edge Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:edge-324vdgb (sha)\n\n\nSwitching Between Meshery Release Channels\n\nUsers are empowered to switch between release channels at their leisure.\n\nSwitching Release Channels Using mesheryctl\n\nUsers can use mesheryctl to switch between release channels, e.g. mesheryctl system channel [stable|edge]. Alternatively, users can manually switch between channels by updating the docker image tags in their meshery.yaml / Kubernetes manifest files. This command generates a meshery.yml (a docker-compose file) with release channel-appropriate tags for the different Docker container images.\n\nViewing Release Channel and Version Information in Meshery UI\n\nUsers are shown their Meshery deployment’s release channel subscription enient new setting in the Preferences area of the Meshery UI, so that people can alternatively use the UI to switch between channels if they like. Version numbers for Meshery adapters are also shown in the UI.\n\nRelease Cadence\n\nMinor releases of the Meshery project are release frequently (on a monthly basis on average) with patch releases made on-demand in-between those times. The project does not have long term releases that are sustained with bug fixes, yet. Bug fixes and patches will be released as needed on the latest release version.\n\nRelease Support\n\nGeneral community support and commercial support from Layer5 is available. Separately, third parties and partners may offer longer-term support solutions.\n\nPre v1.0\n\nProject focuses on functionality, quality and adoption, while retaining the flexibility for shifts in architecture.\n\nPost v1.0\n\nOnce a 1.0 release has been made, Around once a month or so, the project maintainers will take one of these daily builds and run it through a number of additional qualification tests and tag the build as a Stable release. Around once a quarter or so, the project maintainers take one of these Stable releases, run through a bunch more tests and tag the build as a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Finally, if we find something wrong with an LTS release, we issue patches.\n\nThe different types (Daily, Stable, LTS) represent different product quality levels and different levels of support from the Meshery team. In this context, support means that we will produce patch releases for critical issues and offer technical assistance.\n\nVersioning Documentation\n\nFor new major release\n\nThe structure which the docs follow right now is, The main docs folder has the most recent version of documentation, while there are sub-folders for previous versions, v0.x (x being the last major release).\nOn release of a new major version, the static html files for the most recent version is generated and is renamed as the release version (v0.x).\n\nSteps:\n\nAfter cloning the Meshery repository\n\n\n  cd docs &gt; bundle install &gt; make docs\n  On executing make docs a _site folder is created which has static html files.\n  The _site folder is renamed to v0.x.\n  This v0.x folder is now the latest version of docs.\n\n\nIn the v0.x folder\n\n\n  Search and replace all the instances where there is a direct path is defined to include the version name in the path, i.e, all paths to intra-page links and images should start with /v0.x/.\n\n\n\n  Look for href=\"/ and replace with href=\"/0.x/\n  Look for src=\"/and replace with src=\"/0.x/ \n\n\n\n\n\nFor old release\n\nFor older releases we have to travel back in time. Using the Tags in github we go to a previous release, v0.X.x, the .x here should be the latest version of the archived docs.\n\nSteps:\n\n\n  \n    Copy the commit ID for that release. \n\n\n\n  \n  git checkout &lt;commit ID&gt; &gt; cd docs &gt; bundle install &gt; make docs\n  On executing make docs a _site folder is created which has static html files.\n  The _site folder is renamed to v0.X and is copied into the docs folder of the present version.\n\n\nBi-Weekly Meetings\n\nIf you are passionate about CI/CD pipelines, DevOps, automated testing, managing deployments, or if you want to learn how to use Meshery and its features, you are invited to join the bi-weekly Build and Release meetings. Find meeting details and agenda in the community calendar and the meeting minutes document. The meetings are open to everyone and recorded for later viewing. We hope to see you there!"

						"content": "In Meshery, a **Component** is a fundamental building block used to represent and define the infrastructure under management. Each component provides granular and specific support for your infrastructure and applications. Each component represents a distinct capability or feature, like a specific service, protocol, or configuration element. Components can be semantically meaningful (orchestratable) or non-semantically meaningful (an annotation).\n\n## Components as building blocks\n\nMeshery Models and their packaged Components represent a standardized and reusable collection of building blocks used to describe both the desired and actual configuration of infrastructure pre and post-deployment. More than this Components are using to describe non-infrastructure concepts, for example, a component might capture a comment or a visual element that you've placed into a Meshery Design. To aid in distinguishing between types of Components, they are categorized into two groups: Semantic and Non-Semantic components. A component is considered semantically meaningful when it behaves as a direct representation of an aspect of your infrastructure. A component is considered non-semantically meaningful when it behaves as an annotation to aid in the comprehension of your designs.\n\n\n\nOnce registered with Meshery Server (in the [Registry](./registry)), components are available for inclusion in [Designs](./designs) that you create. Components can be created and published by anyone, allowing you to share you custom extensions with the community. This fosters a collaborative ecosystem where you can leverage and contribute to the growing collection of Meshery components.\n\nComponents having the same `kind`, `apiVersion` and `model.name` attributes are considered duplicates."

						"content": "As an cloud native management platform, Meshery has built-in support infastructure and application configuration management. Use Meshery to configure your multi-cluster Kubernetes environments on-premises or across clouds.\n\n## What is a Meshery Design?\n\nMeshery's core construct of configuration management is that of a design. A design is ultimately a document – and a document in which you capture and describe your desired state of improv the environment.\n\n[![Context Aware Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/patterns/context-aware-design.svg\n)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/patterns/context-aware-design.svg)\n\n## Creating a Meshery Design\n\nYou have your choice of how are you would like to create an infrastructure design. You can use the design configurator inside of measure, UI or extensions, like Kanvas, or you can hand code your design, using the mesh model spec, if you like.\n\nYou are free to choose how you would like to create an infrastructure design. You can use the design configurator inside of measure, UI or extensions, like Kanvas, or you can hand code your design, using the mesh model spec, if you like.\n\nUse Meshery UI or mesheryctl to manage [designs]({{ site.baseurl }}/tasks/patterns).\n\n## Pattern Management Through Meshery UI\n\nMeshery also comes with seed patterns when users start Meshery for the first time. These patterns cover common use cases and examples for you as you explore Meshery.\n\n\n\nUsers can also import these patterns to their remote provider from this [sample repository](https://github.com/service-mesh-patterns/service-mesh-patterns/tree/master/samples).\n\n\n\nOnce these patterns are imported, you can then edit these patterns or use the pattern configurator to configure them according to your requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Pattern Management Through Meshery CLI\n\nYou can also manage cloud native patterns through Meshery's CLI, mesheryctl.\n\nThe `mesheryctl design` subcommand lets you import and apply patterns to your cluster.\n\nFor example, if you have your pattern written in a file say, `istio-bookinfo.yaml` which deploys Istio service mesh and onboards the BookInfo app on Istio, you can use mesheryctl to apply this pattern as shown below:\n\n```\nmesheryctl design apply -f istio-bookinfo.yaml\n```\n\nIf you already have a pattern imported into Meshery, you can apply the pattern by name.\n\n```\nmesheryctl design apply BookInfoApp\n```\n\nThis will apply the pattern BookInfoApp, which has already been imported into Meshery.\n\nSee [mesheryctl design subcommand section]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/mesheryctl/#cloud-native-pattern-configuration-and-management) for more details on the `design` subcommand.\n\n## WASM Filters\n\nMeshery can be used for managing WebAssembly Filters through the UI or the CLI.\n\n### Filter Management Through Meshery UI\n\nLike patterns, Meshery also comes with some sample WebAssembly Filters for you to experiment.\n\n\n\nYou can also import these filters manually to your provider from the [wasm-filters](https://github.com/layer5io/wasm-filters) repo.\n\nMeshery's sample application [ImageHub]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/infrastructure-management/deploying-sample-apps) will let you test out configuring these filters out-of-the-box.\n\nYou can onboard ImageHub to an installed service mesh as shown below.\n\n\n\n### Filter Management Through Meshery CLI\n\nYou can also manage WASM filters through Meshery's CLI, mesheryctl.\n\nThe `mesheryctl filter` command lets you import and configure WebAssembly filters.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\nmesheryctl exp filter apply -f metrics_collector_bg.wasm\n```\n\nIf you already have a filter imported into Meshery, you can configure the filter by name.\n\n```\nmesheryctl exp filter apply metrics_collector_bg\n```"

Unmanaged Connections are those that are manually added by the user and are not managed by Meshery.\" %}\n\n## States and the Lifecycle of Connections\n\nMeshery tracks the status of each connections throughout the connection's lifecycle. Meshery is intentional about the currently assigned state and which state a connection may or may not transition to and from. To better understand connection states and their meaning, let's consider an example in which you a `Kubernetes` cluster with `Prometheus` installed.\n\n![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lifecycle-management/states-for-kubernetes-cluster-connections.svg)\n\n### State: Discovered\n\nAll resources discovered by [MeshSync's](meshsync.md) multi-tier discovery or provided as part of config, and if Meshery can integrate, a connection with state as `Discovered` will be created. Though, the connection/resources are not tested for its reachability/usability i.e. Meshery has not made an attempt to connect or manage the connection.\n\nWhen a connection has been discovered, it will be listed in the MeshSync browser / Connections table in Meshery UI. You can self transition a particular connection to [Register](#state-registered) / [Ignore](#state-ignored) state.\n\n> Example: MeshSync discovers Prometheus components and inform Meshery Server about available Prometheus connection, but Meshery is yet to [connect](#state-connected) and start scraping metrics.\n\n### State: Registered\n\nThe connection in this state have been verified for its use and reachability but not yet being used. Almost all reachable connections will auto transition to Registered state from [Discovered](#state-discovered) state and it is upto the user what to do with this connection (i.e. User needs to administratively process the connection). It can be transitioned to [Connected](#state-connected), [Maintenance](#state-maintenance) and [Not Found](#state-not-found).\n\n> Example: User manually selects the registered Prometheus connection and transition to the [connected](#state-connected) state (i.e. User administratively processes the connection).\n\n### State: Connected\n\nThe connection in this state is administratively processed and being actively managed by Meshery. User can interface and invoke set of actions with the connection.\nFrom this state the transition can happen to either [Maintenance](#state-maintenance) or [Ignore](#state-ignored) state.\nAuto transition to [Disconnected](#state-disconnected) state will occur if Meshery can no longer communicate with the connection, which can occur due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside Meshery or any other issue.\n\n> Example: Meshery is communicating with Prometheus APIs to scrape metrics and present it in the UI.\n\n_Certain connections can auto-transition to connected state._\n\n### State: Ignored\n\nThe connection is administratively processed to be ignored from Meshery's view of management. Meshery will not re-discover this connection even when current user session gets expired.\n\n> Example: Meshery server will stop/not scrape metrics from Prometheus. Though, the previous data (if connected previously) will continue to exist and user needs to manually delete.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Ignored versus Disconnected\" content=\"You might intentionally choose to have Meshery ignore a given Prometheus connection, explicitly leaving in Meshery’s field of view, but identifying it as a connection not to manage. This is distinctly different than a Prometheus that Meshery was managing, but has been turned off/uninstalled and now Meshery is disconnected from the Prometheus.\" %}\n\n### State: Maintenance\n\nThe connection is administratively processed to be offline for maintenance tasks. This is different from being [Disconnected](#state-disconnected)/[Ignored](#state-ignored).\n\n### State: Disconnected\n\nThe connection was previously [discovered](#state-discovered)/[registered](#state-registered)/[connected](#state-connected) but is not available currently. This could happen due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside meshery/administratively disconnected.\n\n> Example: Prometheus crashed/API token provided at time of registration is revoked.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Disconnected vs Deleted\" content=\"The connection was previously connected but is unreachable due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was **deleted outside Meshery** i.e. Connection was deleted beyond the Meshery's view of management.\" %}\n\n### State: Deleted\n\nThe connection is administratively processed to be deleted and removed from Meshery's view of management. All the available/collected data will also be deleted.\n\n> Example: Prometheus metrics will no longer be accessible to you from the Meshery UI.\n\n### State: Not Found\n\nUser tried registering the connection **manually** but Meshery could not connect to it or if the connection is unavailable now. User can delete the connection or try re-registering.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Not Found vs Disconnected\" content=\"You might attempt to transition to Connected state but the connection is unavaialble now due to being deleted/some other reason. This is distinctly different than a cluster with Prometheuses installed for `application monitoring` which was connected previously but is now unreachable from Meshery's view of management due to change in API token/similar issue.\" %}\n\n_Connections like **Registration of Meshery server with remote provider** (and few other connection types) can self transtion to the valid states._\n\n## Registering Connections with Remote Providers\n\nTo register a connection with a remote provider, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the necessary credentials or access tokens from the remote provider.\n2. Open the Meshery UI and navigate to the Connections page.\n3. Click on the \"Add Connection\" button.\n4. Fill in the required information, such as the provider type, name, and credentials.\n5. Click on the \"Register\" button to register the connection.\n\nOnce the connection is registered, Meshery will verify its reachability and usability. If successful, the connection will transition to the \"Registered\" state. From there, you can choose to administratively process the connection and transition it to the \"Connected\" state.\n\nNote that some connections, such as the registration of Meshery server with remote providers, can self-transition to valid states.\n\nFor more information on the different states and the lifecycle of connections, refer to the documentation above.\n\n![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/architecture/meshery-server-registration-with-remote-providers.svg)"

						"content": "Meshery Adapters are the Extension Points in Meshery’s architecture. Their design, the process of creating a new adapter is documented in Extensibility: Meshery Adapters.\n\nWith the CONTRIBUTING.md in mind, understand that development follows the usual fork-and-pull request workflow described here, see also GitHub Process. On forking GitHub deactivates all workflows. It is safe and good practice to activate them such that the code is validated on each push. This requires that branches filter for “on push” is set to ‘**’ to be triggered also on branches containing ‘/’  in their name.  The actions are parameterized using secrets (see Build &amp; Release Strategy). The Docker image is only built and pushed to Docker Hub if a tag is pushed and the corresponding authentication information is configured. The only secret that should be set in each fork is GO_VERSION, specified in Build &amp; Release Strategy, otherwise, the corresponding action’s default version is used.\n\nEach commit has to be signed off, see Contributing Overview.\n\nRunning an adapter as a container\n\nTesting your local changes running as a container can be accomplished in two ways:\n\n\n  Define the adapter’s address in the UI: Unless the running container is named as specified in the docker-run target in the Makefile, the container has to be removed manually first. Then, run make docker followed by make docker-run. Then, connect to the adapter in the UI in “Settings &gt; Adapters” using localhost:&lt;port&gt; if the meshery server is running as a binary, or : if it is running as a docker container.\n  Using mesheryctl: In ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml, change the tag specifying the image of the adapter to “latest”. Run make docker, followed by mesheryctl system start --skip-update. This assumes mesheryctl system start has been executed at least once before.\n\n\nRunning an adapter as a process\n\nAnother way to test your local changes is to run the adapter as a process. To do this, clone the meshery/meshery repository, and start Meshery Server using make server. Start the adapter from your IDE, or by executing make run. Then, in Meshery UI, add the adapter using “localhost:”.\n\nCreating a new Meshery Adapter\n\nMeshery uses adapters to manage and interact with different cloud native infrastructure. Meshery adapters are written in Go. Whether you are creating a new adapter or modifying an existing adapter, be sure to read the Meshery Adapters design specification. For new adapters, start with the Repository Template(https://github.com/meshery/meshery).\n\n\n  Get the proto buf spec file from Meshery repo:\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshery/meshery/master/meshes/meshops.proto\n  Generate code\n    \n      Using Go as an example, do the following:\n        \n          adding GOPATH to PATH: export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin\n          install grpc: go get -u google.golang.org/grpc\n          install protoc plugin for go: go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go\n          Generate Go code: protoc -I meshes/ meshes/meshops.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:./meshes/\n        \n      \n      For other languages, please refer to gRPC.io for language-specific guides.\n    \n  \n  Implement the service methods and expose the gRPC server on a port of your choice (e.g. 10000).\n\n\nTip: The Meshery Adapter for Istio is a good reference adapter to use as an example of a Meshery Adapter."

Fork and clone the Meshery repo. cd mesheryctl to change directory mesheryctl’s source.\n\nAfter making changes, run make in the mesheryctl folder to build the binary. You can then use the binary by, say, ./mesheryctl system start.\n\nFramework\n\nmesheryctl uses the Cobra framework. A good first-step towards contributing to mesheryctl would be to familiarise yourself with the Cobra concepts. For manipulating config files, mesheryctl uses Viper.\n\nModel and Configuration Data\n\nA central struct is maintained in the mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/config/config.go file. These are updated and should be used for getting the Meshery configuration.\n\nUpdates to this central struct is made through updates in Context with setter functions. The changes made in this central struct are reflected back in the Meshery configuration file (.meshery/config.yaml).\n\nLogging\n\nFor logs, mesheryctl uses Logrus. Going through the docs and understanding the different log-levels will help a lot.\n\nLinting\n\nmesheryctl uses golangci-lint. See the .github/workflow/ci.yaml for syntax used during Meshery’s build process.\n\nUnit Tests\n\nUnit test code coverage reports can be found in the CodeCov logs. Note: GitHub login may be required for access.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe documentation pages for mesheryctl reference are made with the help of the Cobra Golang framework and use of GitHub Actions. Refer to Contributing to mesheryctl documentation for details.\n\nMeshery CLI Style Guide\n\nThese guidelines are a collection of principles and conventions that need to be followed while designing mesheryctl commands. mesheryctl might be the interface that the users first have with Meshery. As such, mesheryctl needs to provide a great UX.\n\nThe following principles should be taken in mind while designing mesheryctl commands-\n\nDesign Principles\n\n1. Consistency is quality.\n\n\n  Consistency of interaction drives a quality user experience. Whether that experience is delightful or painful is a related, but separate consideration. Meshery’s behavior of user interactions should be consistent even when their user experience is poor.\n\n\n2. Intuitive user experiences feel natural to users.\n\n\n  When being designed, each of Meshery’s user experiences should be examined first from the user’s perspective. Design user experiences that are familiar.\n\n\n3. Design for brevity.\n\n\n  Avoid long commands with chained series of flags.\n\n\n4. Design with automated testing in mind.\n\n\n  Provide possibility to specify output format as json (-o json) for easy inspection of command response.\n\n\nPart of delivering a great user experience is providing intuitive interfaces. In the case of mesheryctl takes inspiration from and delivers similar user experiences as popular CLIs do in this ecosystem, like kubectl and docker. Here is relevant kubectl information to reference - Kubectl SIG CLI Community Meeting Minutes, contributing to kubectl, code.\n\nCommand structure and command behavior should be designed in such a way that they are intuitive. Users should ideally be able to understand what a command is used for without having to extensively go through the documentation. For example, mesheryctl design apply -f &lt;design name&gt; requires no further clarification as it is evident that the command will apply the design specified.\n\nConsistency is key when designing intuitive interfaces. Although mesheryctl perf run -f &lt;performance profile name&gt; may sound more intuitive, users who are experienced in using the CLI will prefer the consistent verb apply over run. This will also ensure a consistent command language making memorizing easier.\n\nFlags\n\nConsistency should also be enforced when chaining commands and using flags. For example, if mesheryctl design has a list and view command and has an -all and --output flag, then, similar commands like mesheryctl perf should also support the same commands and flags and provide a consistent user experience.\n\nRational defaults overridden with flags\n\nDefault behaviour should be optimised for what users will need to do most of the time.\n\nThese assumed defaults should be easily overridden by the user with flags.\n\nFor example, mesheryctl system context create &lt;context name&gt; assumes a default platform for the created context. But this can be easily overridden with the --platform flag.\n\nUser Experience: GUI vs CLI\n\nIdeally, all functionally provided in Meshery UI should be available to users via CLI (in mesheryctl). Meshery strives for parity of functionality between it’s two clients. For example, viewing a performance profile in the GUI and with mesheryctl system perf view &lt;profile name&gt; in the CLI should show the same data.\n\nCommand line interfaces offer less context to the user, which makes them inherently less intuitive compared to graphical user interfaces. Both of these user interfaces, however, are the same in that they are both clients of Meshery Server. Both clients are a user experience and as such, to be attended to in this way. The following considerations should be accounted for when designing mesheryctl experiences:\n\n\n  Provide only relevant output. Use “debug” logs that can be accessed with --verbose flag wherever needed.\n  Add headers to output to give context to the user.\n  As mentioned above, similar commands should behave similarly.\n  Confirm steps for risky commands. For example, use the AskForConfirmation function which will prompt the user to type in “yes” or “no” to continue.\n  Anticipate user actions. If the user creates a new context with mesheryctl system context create then the next action might be mesheryctl system start to start Meshery ot mesheryctl system context switch to switch context names.\n  Anticipate user errors. For example, if the user types in mesheryctl system satrt, using the inbuilt features with the cobra library, we can correct it to start and alert the user.\n\n\nDesigning Commands\n\nIf you are working on a new command or adding a new feature on an existing command, it is recommended to setup a design spec so that other contributors can weigh in on the design before you start to code.Broader features should have a design spec made in Google Doc. Check this Google Doc out, which has detailed information on creating a Design Specification.\nFor small changes, communicating over the issue tracker or the discussions will be helpful.\n\nWhen designing for the command line interface, ask and consider the following questions.\n\nWhat the command does\n\n\n  What makes sense to do from a terminal? What doesn’t?\n  What might people want to automate?\n  What is the default behavior? What flags might you need to change that behavior?\n  What might people try and fail to do and how can you anticipate that?\n\n\nWhat the command is called\n\n\n  What should be the command language? (mesheryctl &lt;command&gt; &lt;subcommand&gt; [args] [flags] [value])\n  What should be a command vs a flag?\n  How can you align the language of the new command with the existing commands?\n\n\nWhat are the command outputs\n\n\n  How can you make the GUI and the CLI outputs similar?\n  What should be outputted normally and what falls into debug logs?\n\n\nHow you would explain your command\n\nYou will need to provide a short and long description of the command for the help pages and also for the Meshery Documentation.\n\nWriting unit tests and integration tests for mesheryctl\n\nUnit tests and integration tests are essential to make each mesheryctl release robust and fault tolerant.\n\nBelow you will find guidelines to write unit tests and integration tests and examples of how they are implemented in mesheryctl.\n\nUnit tests: Individual components are tested.\n\nIntegration tests: Individual components are combined and tested as a group.\n\nContributing to mesheryctl documentation\n\nThe Meshery CLI Reference is autogenerated based on docs sections in each of mesheryctl’s Golang files. Meshery CLI Reference pages are updated each time a change to its respective mesheryctl Golang file is merged into the project’s master branch. This approach to documentation facilitates a single source of truth for CLI syntax and command behavior, which results in higher quality reference and a reduction in the toil involved in keeping documentation up-to-date. To contribute to the Meshery CLI Reference, follow these steps:\n\n\n  Go to the required command file in which the documentation has to be created/updated (mainly under /mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/…)\n  Then, edit the Cobra macro variables present in the each file. An example is given below for reference.\n\n\n\n\nvar startCmd = &amp;cobra.Command{\nUse:   &quot;start&quot;,\nShort: &quot;Start Meshery&quot;,\nLong:  &#39;Start Meshery and each of its components.&#39;,\nArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\nExample:```\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s```,\nAnnotations: linkScreenshot,\n...\n\n\n\nThe variables present in above sample will be used in creating the doc pages for the specific command\n\nAlso, if the screenshot is present in the command, an Annotation macro variable (of map[string]string type) containing the link and the caption has to be added at the bottom of the Examples field in the command file. The image file has to be included in the docs/assets folder in PNG format. The screenshot field is given for reference below\n\n\n\nvar linkDocPatternApply = map[string]string{\n\t&quot;link&quot;:    &quot;![pattern-apply-usage](/assets/img/mesheryctl/patternApply.png)&quot;,\n\t&quot;caption&quot;: &quot;Usage of mesheryctl design apply&quot;,\n}\n...\nExample:```\n// apply a pattern file\nmesheryctl design apply -f [file | URL]\n\n// deploy a saved design\nmesheryctl design apply [design-name]```,\nAnnotations: linkDocPatternApply,\n...\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is advised not to modify the changes in docs folder, rather should be done in mesheryctl folder as the changes will get overwritten by the script.\n\nAdding New/Removing Existing commands in the reference index\n\nThough the command page is generated automatically by the Cobra CLI library, there are chances where the command does not appear in the reference index page. In such cases, the command details must be manually added to the reference index YAML file. This is generally done by editing the below two files:\n\n\n  cmds.yml - The YAML file containing the data about the commands\n  mesheryctl-commands.md - The markdown page of the command reference documentation\n\n\nPreserving Manually Added Documentation\n\nmesheryctl uses Cobra CLI library and GitHub Actions to automate the generation of command documentation pages. On occasion, additional documentation beyond that included in the mesheryctl Golang files is ideal to capture and include in the CLI reference pages. Contributors are encouraged to add more usage examples, screenshots to any of the CLI reference pages. To protect any manually added content and ensure it remains intact after regeneration, create a separate Jekyll include file. Follow file naming scheme outlined below:\n\nIf your mesheryctl docs end like this, add the include tag at the end of the file. An example is given below\n\n\n\n\nExample:```\n// apply a pattern file\nmesheryctl design apply -f [file | URL]\n\n// deploy a saved design\nmesheryctl design apply [design-name]```,\nAnnotations: linkDocPatternApply,\n...\n&lt;pre class=&#39;codeblock-pre&#39;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&#39;codeblock&#39;&gt;\n      --config string   path to config file (default &quot;/home/runner/.meshery/config.yaml&quot;)\n  -t, --token string    Path to token file default from current context\n  -v, --verbose         verbose output\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n{% include permalink-of-file %}\n\n\n\n\nThis format should reference an external file where your manual changes are stored. These files should be present at the folder path (_includes/mesheryctl/). Any content added using this method will not be altered during the documentation generation process, but instead will be included post-auto doc generation. When making new changes or additions, understand that these additional details are positioned at the end their given CLI reference page, so bear this in mind as you organize and present your additional command details.\n\nReferences\n\n\n  jarcoal/httpmock\n  Unit testing CLIs in Go\n  How to test CLI commands with Go and Cobra\n  Contributing to Meshery API Swagger Documentation\n\n\nKey principles\n\nThe following key principles should be taken to mind when writing tests:\n\n\n  Golang’s standard library will be used to write tests.\n  The tests should cover all possible use cases and not just the happy paths.\n  Integration tests should contain the keyword “Integration” in the title and should be marked to be skipped under unit testing. (See below)\n  Fixtures are mock/raw data to use(for e.g. API response to mock an HTTP call).\n  Testdata is the expected response of mesheryctl commands or functions.\n  The mock data and the expected responses are stored in the golden files.\n  Table formatted tests are performed on functions and commands.\n  mesheryctl/pkg/utils/fixtures/validate.version.github.golden file needs to be updated regularly.\n  The version in utils.NewTestHelper() should be updated regularly.\n  Golden files should be updated synchronously as API responses, mesheryctl outputs are updated.\n\n\nMarking integration tests under unit tests\n\nSince there is no straightforward way to mark unit tests and integration tests differently. Here we use the --short flag while running tests to differentiate between unit tests and integration tests.\n\n\n\nfunc TestPreflightCmdIntegration(t *testing.T) {\n   // skipping this integration test with --short flag\n   if testing.Short() {\n       t.Skip(&quot;skipping integration test&quot;)\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, the test is marked with “Integration” in the title and if a --short flag is passed with the command, this test is skipped.\n\nRunning tests in GitHub workflows\n\nUnit tests:\n\n\n\ngo test --short ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic\n\n\n\nIntegration tests:\n\n\n\ngo test -run Integration ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic\n\n\n\nTo update golden files with the test output use the --update flag:\n\n\n\nvar update = flag.Bool(&quot;update&quot;, false, &quot;update golden files&quot;)\n\n\n\nTo grab console logs - fmt.Println() (check mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/perf/view_test.go )\n\nTo grab Logrus logs - logrus.Info() (check mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/perf/apply_test.go )"

Jekyll can be installed on different platforms like Windows, Linux, and MacOS by the following steps \n\n\nFor Windows\n\n\nNote\nWindows users can run Jekyll by following the Windows Installation Guide and also installing Ruby Version Manager RVM. RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to work with multiple Ruby environments on your local machine. Alternatively, if you're running Windows 10 version 1903 Build 18362 or higher, you can upgrade to Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL and run Jekyll in Linux instead.\n\n\n\n  \n    Fire up your WSL VM and install the ruby version manager (RVM):\n\n    \nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install curl g++ gnupg gcc autoconf automake bison build-essential libc6-dev \\\n \tlibffi-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libsqlite3-dev libtool \\\n \tlibyaml-dev make pkg-config sqlite3 zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev \\\n \tlibreadline-dev libssl-dev\nsudo gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\ncurl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable\nsudo usermod -a -G rvm `whoami`\n\n\n\n    If gpg --keyserver gives an error, you can use:\n\n    \nsudo gpg --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\n\n\n\n    OR\n\n    \nsudo gpg2 --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB %}\n\n\n\n    Restart your WSL VM before moving forward to install Ruby.\n  \n  \n    To install Ruby, run:\n\n    \n  bash\n  rvm install ruby\n  rvm --default use ruby 2.7.5\n  gem update\n  gem install jekyll bundler\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Update the Gemfile located in meshery/docs directory\n\n    \n  ruby '3.0.2'\n  \n  \n\n    Note: In place of 3.0.2 add your installed version\n  \n  \n    Also add this to the next line in the Gemfile.\n    \n  gem 'wdm','&gt;=0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nDon't Commit Gemfile\nThis is just a workaround for your local machine.

If this command results in an error, try running the server without Livereload using the command: $ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --config _config_dev.yml. Note that you will have to manually restart the server to reflect any changes made without Livereload. There are two Jekyll configurations, jekyll serve for local development and jekyll build to generate site artefacts for production deployment.\n  \n\n\nUsing Docker\n\nIf you’ve Docker and make installed in your system, then you can serve the site locally. This doesn’t require the need to install Jekyll and Ruby in your system.\n\n\ninfo\nThis may not work in Windows.\n\n\nRun the following command from the docs folder, else it will fail.\n\n\n\nmake docker\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Note\n\nWhile performing any of the above steps, if you receive an error about mismatching ruby versions similar to the example below, follow one of the steps mentioned below.\n\nYour ruby version is x.x.x but your Gemfile specified 2.7.x\n\nThe reason for this error is because Jekyll always considers the exact version of Ruby unlike JavaScript.\n\n\n  Install the required Ruby version by using rvm or by any means given above.\n  \n    If you’re unable to install the required Ruby version, then manually configure the Gemfile (This is not recommended and should be done only if the above steps fail). Modify the ruby version inside the Gemfile similar to the example below:\n\n    \nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\nruby '3.1.1' //Change to the version you have installed\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe Gemfile.lock will be updated automatically once the make docs command is run. \n(For Windows, run bundle exec jekyll serve if WSL2 isn’t present)\n\n\nDon't Commit Gemfile\nIf you have followed the third step then please don't commit the changes made on `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` in your branch to preserve integrity, else the CI action will fail to generate the site preview during PR.\n\n\nUsing Gitpod\n\n  Ensure you have an account on Gitpod and add the Gitpod extension to your browser.\n  Open your forked Meshery repository on GitHub.\n  Click on the “Gitpod” button in the top right corner of the repository page (it is only visible with the Gitpod browser extension installed).\n\n\n\nAbout Gitpod\nGitpod will automatically clone and open the repository for you in a browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. It will also automatically build the project for you on launch, comes with Docker and other tools pre-installed, making it one of the fastest ways to spin up a development environment for Meshery.\n\n\n\n  \n    After opening the project on Gitpod, change to the docs directory.\n\n    \ncd docs\n\n\n  \n  \n    Serve the code locally.\n\n    \nmake docs\n\n\n  \n\n\nYou should be able to access the site on port 4000. If you want to access it in your localhost read the docs for port-forwarding using ssh.\n\nMake Necessary Changes\n\n  Make changes as required based on the issue you are solving.\n  Ensure to verify that your changes reflect correctly by serving the site locally using make docs.\n\n\n\nNote\nIf the issue requires making new doc page that replaces the old page, please don't forget to add a redirect link on the old page. This redirect link field should have the link of the new page created.\n\n\nCreate a Pull Request\n\n\n  \n    After making changes, don’t forget to commit with the sign-off flag (-s)!\n\n    \ngit commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”\n\n\n  \n  \n    Once all changes have been committed, push the changes.\n\n    \ngit push origin [branch-name]\n\n\n  \n  \n    Then on Github, navigate to the Meshery repository and create a pull request from your recently pushed changes!\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  See the Meshery Documentation Google Doc for additional reference.\n\n\nUsing the features of Meshery Docs\n\nClipboard Feature\n\nMost popular clipboard plugins like Clipboard JS require the manual creation of a new ID for each code snippet. A different approach is used here. For code snippets, we either use html tags or markdown in the following manner:\n\n\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;codeblock-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot;&gt;\n&lt;code class=&quot;clipboardjs&quot;&gt;code_snippet_here&lt;/code&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n\n\nYou can also use the code component created for this feature to make it easy to use. It can be used by including code.html and then passing the code snippet to it.\n\nIf the code snippet does not contain any special characters then, it can be used directly as below:\n{% include code.html code=\"code_snippet_here\" %}`\n\nIf the code snippet has special characters then it must be captured first in variable code_content,  and then pass it to the component.\n{% capture code_content%}code_snippet_here{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n\nDon’t use code component when the snippet is in between an ordered list, this breaks the order and next item in the list will start numbering from 1. Instead, use &lt;pre class=\"codeblock_pre\"&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; method described above.”\n\nA full block:\n\n\n\n```code snippet```\n\n\n\nInline formatting:\n\n\n\n\\`code snippet\\`: `code snippet`\n\n\n\nLanguage specific:\n\n\n\n```(language name)\ncode snippet\n```\n\n\n\nWhenever the code tags are detected, the clipboard javascript file is automatically loaded. Each code element is given a custom id and a clipboard-copy icon to copy the content.\n\nDocumentation Contribution Flow Summary\n\n\nNote\nFor contributing `mesheryctl` reference section, refer Contributing CLI\n\n\nThe following is a concise summary of the steps to contribute to Meshery documentation.\n\n\n  Create a fork, if you have not already, by following the steps described here\n  In the local copy of your fork, navigate to the docs folder.\ncd docs\n  Create and checkout a new branch to make changes within\ngit checkout -b &lt;my-changes&gt;\n  Edit/add documentation.\nvi &lt;specific page&gt;.md\n  Add redirect link on the old page (only when a new page is created that replaces the old page)\n  Run site locally to preview changes.\nmake docs\n  Commit, sign-off, and push changes to your remote branch.\ngit push origin &lt;my-changes&gt;\n  Open a pull request (in your web browser) against the repo: https://github.com/meshery/meshery.\n\n\nNavigation Table of Contents in Sidebar (toc)\n\nSidebars use toc to create a table of contents. It is written in the following manner:\n\n    toc:\n  - title: Group 1\n    subfolderitems:\n      - page: Thing 1\n        url: /thing1.html\n      - page: Thing 2\n        url: /thing2.html\n      - page: Thing 3\n        url: /thing3.html\n\n\nThe output of the code snippet would be:\n\n    Group 1\n      Thing 1\n      Thing 2\n      Thing 3\n\n\nIn this example, Group 1 is a parent section within the Table of Contents, and Thing 1, Thing 2, and Thing 3 are children of Group 1. This is a direct hierarchy with a single level of children under the parent.\n\nGrandchildren are added in the sidebars in the following manner:\n\n    toc:\n  - title: Group 1\n    subfolderitems:\n      - page: Thing 1\n        url: /thing1.html\n        subfolderitems:\n          - page: Subthing 1.1\n            url: /subthing1_1.html\n          - page: Subthing 1.2\n            url: /subthing1_2.html\n      - page: Thing 2\n        url: /thing2.html\n      - page: Thing 3\n        url: /thing3.html\n\n\nThe output of the code snippet would be:\n\n    Group 1\n      Thing 1\n       Subthing 1.1\n       Subthing 1.2\n      Thing 2\n      Thing 3\n\n\nHere, Subthing 1.1 and Subthing 1.2 are the grandchildren of Thing 1.\n\nIn docs/_includes/sidebar.html contains three levels of navigation hierarchy.\n\n\n  Parent: It serves as a top level category for related content.\n  Children: They are immediate subsections or topics that fall under the parent section.\n  Grandchildren: They are nested under Thing 1 and provide a more detailed breakdown of information within the child section. Grandchildren are used to organize content further, offering a more detailed structure for a specific topic.\n\n\nThese sections create a hierarchical and organized navigation experience for readers.\n\nAlerts\n\n\nWhat is an alert?\nAn alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary. This example is an info box, and the code for another might look like this:\n\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Here is another!\" %}\n\n\nJust for fun, here are all the types:\n\n\nwarning\nThis is a warning\n\n\n\ndanger\nThis alerts danger!\n\n\n\nsuccess\nThis alerts success\n\n\n\ninfo\nThis is useful information.\n\n\n\nprimary\nThis is a primary alert\n\n\n\nsecondary\nThis is a secondary alert\n\n\n\nlight\nThis is a light alert\n\n\n\ndark\nThis is a dark alert\n\n\nalert.html\n\nMeshery Docs has a common include file alert.html, to provide consistent formatting for notes, warnings, and various informative callouts intended for the readers.\n\nTo use the alert.html feature in our documentation include the following code:\n  {% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Here is another!\" %}\n\n\nOther supported alert types include warning, danger,success,primary, secondary, light, dark .\n\nQuotes\n\nYou can include block quotes to emphasize text.\n\n\n  Here is an example. Isn’t this much more prominent to the user?\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nAdding Integration Specific Information to Individual Integration Pages\n\nIntegration pages (example) are automatically generated, however, integration specific documentation is often needed.\n\nmodelscustominfo collection holds custom markdown files. Follow these steps:\n\n\n  Create a file inside the modelscustominfo collection.\n  Ensure the file includes frontmatter with the title key, set to the title of the integration.\n\n\nThe content that follows the frontmatter in this file will be automatically parsed and rendered on the integration page\n\nExample:\n\nfile: _modelscustominfo/aad.md\n\n---\ntitle: Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n---\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Azure Active Directory (AAD)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\nIn this example, the heading “Azure Active Directory” will be displayed on the integration page:\nAzure Active Directory Integration Page\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nDisable suggested reading by setting the suggested-reading frontmatter variable to false.\n\nEditable Intra-page Table of Contents Toolbar\n\nControl the display of this intra-page navigator with either page level or layout level frontmatter variables:\n\ndisplay-toolbar\n\nSet to true (make “editable” toolbar visible) or false (hide “editable” toolbar)\n\nif conditional\n\nThis executes the block of code only if the given condition is true. It is executed in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% if product.title == &#39;Awesome Shoes&#39; %}\n  These shoes are awesome!\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\n\nIf the condition is true, the output would be:\n\n    These shoes are awesome!\n\n\nfor loop\n\nThe for statement executes a block of code repeatedly. It is wriiten in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% for names in collection.names %}\n  {{ name.title }}\n{% endfor %}\n\n\n\nThe output produced by the above code snippet:\n\n    Sam Ham Ethan\n\n\nComment\n\nComments allow to leave a block of code unattended, any statements between opening and closing comment would not be executed.\n\nInclude\n\nThe above tag is used to insert a already rendered file within the current template. It is written in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% include file.html %}\n\n\n\nAssign\n\nThe assign tag is used to create a new variable. It is written in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% assign variable1 = true %}\n\n\n\nTwo helpful resources:\n\n\n  Liquid Docs - https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\n  Jekyll Docs - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/"

						"title": "How to write MeshKit compatible errors",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-error",
						"content": "Meshery pervasively uses MeshKit as a golang and infrastructure management-specific library in all of its components. MeshKit helps populate error messages with a uniform and useful set of informative attributes.\n\nTo help with creating error codes, MeshKit contains a tool that analyzes, verifies and updates error codes in Meshery source code trees. It extracts error details into a file that can be used for publishing all error code references on the Meshery error codes reference page. The objective to create this was to avoid centralized handling of error codes and automating everything\n\nIn order to create a Meshery error object, you will need to create a custom wrapper object for the native golang error. This can be done from the MeshKit Error package.\n\nThis tool will create a couple of files, one of them is designed to be used to generate the error reference on the Meshery Documentation website. The file errorutil_analyze_summary.json contains a summary of the analysis, notably lists of duplicates etc.\n\nConventions to follow while creating errors\n\n\n  Errors names and codes are namespaced to components, i.e. they need to be unique within a component, which is verified by this tool.\n  Errors are not to be reused across components and modules.\n  Error codes are not to be set as integer. CI will take care of updating Error codes from a string to an integer.\n  Running make error analyzes your code and returns any warnings to be aware of.\n  Capitalize the first letter of the every error description.\n  Using errors.NewDefault(…) is deprecated. This tool emits a warning if its use is detected.\n  Use errors.New(…) from MeshKit to create actual errors with all the details.\n  This is often done in a factory function. It is important that the error code variable is used here, not a literal.\n  Specify detailed descriptions, probable causes, and remedies. They need to be string literals, call expressions are ignored.\n  This tool extracts this information from the code and exports it.\n  For the Code argument in the errors.New use the same Error name and append a “Code” after it. e.g error name : ErrApplyManifest then the error code is ErrApplyManifestCode\n  Set the value to any string, like “replace_me” (no convention here), e.g. ErrApplyManifestCode = “replace_me”.\n  By convention, error codes and the factory functions live in files called error.go. The tool checks all files, but updates only error.go files.\n\n\nUse the errors.New() function to create a new instance of the error object and pass situation-specific attributes as function arguments. These attributes are:\n\n\n  Code\n  Short Description\n  Long Description\n  Probable Cause\n  Suggested Remediation\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\nerrors.New(ErrExampleCode, errors.Alert, []string{&quot;&lt;short-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;long-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;probable-cause&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;suggested remediation&gt;&quot;})\n\n\nExample\n\nIn this example we are creating an Error for being unable to marshal JSON\n\n\n\nvar (\n\t// Error code\n    ErrMarshalCode= &quot;replace_me&quot;\n\n    //Static errors (for example)\n    ErrExample = errors.New(ErrExampleCode, errors.Alert, []string{&quot;&lt;short-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;long-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;probable-cause&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;suggested remediation&gt;&quot;})\n)\n\n// Dynamic errors\n//Error Name\nfunc ErrMarshal(err error, obj string) error {\n\treturn errors.New(ErrMarshalCode, errors.Alert, []string{&quot;Unable to marshal the : &quot;, obj}, []string{err.Error()}, []string{}, []string{})\n}\n\n\n\nReplacing old Error Codes\n\nOld\n\n\n\nbd, err := json.Marshal(providers)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, &quot;unable to marshal the providers&quot;, http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\nNew\n\n\n\nbd, err := json.Marshal(providers)\n  if err != nil {\n          obj := &quot;provider&quot;\n          http.Error(w, ErrMarshal(err, obj).Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n          return\n      }\n\n\n\nReplacing logrus\n\nThere already exists an interface for logger in MeshKit.\n\n\nWARNING\nTo enforce the use of meshkit errors, meshkit logger was designed such that it only works with meshkit errors. If a non-meshkit error is logged through the logger, it would panic and kill the process. See: meshkit#119 for more insight.\n\n\nDefining a Logger\n\n\n\ntype Logger struct {\n\tlog   logger.Handler\n}\n\n\n\nDebug\n\nOld\n\n\n\nlogrus.Debugf(&quot;meshLocationURL: %s&quot;, meshLocationURL)\n\n\n\nNew\n\n\n\nl.log.Debug(&quot;meshLocationURL: &quot;, meshLocationURL)\n\n\n\nError\n\nOld\n\n\n\nlogrus.Errorf(&quot;error marshaling data: %v.&quot;, err)\n\n\n\nNew\n\n\n\nl.log.Error(ErrMarshal(err, obj))\n\n\n\nA small program using meshkit errors and logger\n\n\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\n\t&quot;os&quot;\n\n\tmeshkitErrors &quot;github.com/layer5io/meshkit/errors&quot;\n\t&quot;github.com/layer5io/meshkit/logger&quot;\n\t&quot;github.com/sirupsen/logrus&quot;\n\t&quot;github.com/spf13/viper&quot;\n)\n\nvar (\n\t// CI will replace `test_code` with new error code\n\tErrOpeningFileCode = &quot;test_code&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tlogLevel := viper.GetInt(&quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot;)\n\tif viper.GetBool(&quot;DEBUG&quot;) {\n\t\tlogLevel = int(logrus.DebugLevel)\n\t}\n\tlog, err := logger.New(&quot;test&quot;, logger.Options{\n\t\tFormat:   logger.SyslogLogFormat,\n\t\tLogLevel: logLevel,\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// logging meshkit error\n\terr = openFileWithMeshkitError(&quot;some.txt&quot;)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t}\n\t// OUTPUT\n\t// ERRO[2021-11-10T17:31:28+05:30] open some.txt: no such file or directory\n\t// app=test code=1001 probable-cause=&quot;empty string passed as argument .file with this name doesn&#39;t exist&quot;\n\t// severity=2 short-description=&quot;unable to open file&quot; suggested-remediation=&quot;pass a non-empty string as\n\t// filename .create file before opening it&quot;\n\n\t// logging non meshkit error\n\terr = openFile(&quot;some.txt&quot;)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t}\n\t// OUTPUT\n\t// ERRO[2024-07-01T19:09:09+05:30] open some.txt: no such file or directory\n\t// app=test code= probable-cause= severity=0 short-description= suggested-remediation=\n\n}\n\n// this returns a non meshkit error\nfunc openFile(name string) error {\n\t_, err := os.Open(name)\n\treturn err\n}\n\n// this returns a meshkit error\nfunc openFileWithMeshkitError(name string) error {\n\t_, err := os.Open(name)\n\treturn ErrOpeningFile(err)\n}\n\nfunc ErrOpeningFile(err error) error {\n\treturn meshkitErrors.New(ErrOpeningFileCode, meshkitErrors.Alert, []string{&quot;unable to open file&quot;},\n\t\t[]string{err.Error()},\n\t\t[]string{&quot;empty string passed as argument &quot;, &quot;file with this name doesn&#39;t exist&quot;},\n\t\t[]string{&quot;pass a non-empty string as filename &quot;, &quot;create file before opening it&quot;})\n}"

						"title": "Contributing to Meshery using git",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-gitflow",
						"content": "Working by Forking\n\nJust head over to the GitHub page and click the “Fork” button. It’s just that simple. Once you’ve done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or just head straight to the command line:\n\nClone your fork to your local machine\n\ngit clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git\n\n\nKeeping Your Fork Up to Date\nWhile this isn’t a necessary step, if you plan on doing anything more than just a tiny quick fix, you’ll want to make sure you keep your fork up to date by tracking the original “upstream” repo that you forked. To do this, you’ll need to add a remote:\n\nAdd ‘upstream’ repo to list of remotes\n\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/meshery/meshery.git\n\n\n(“meshery” is used as the example repo. Be sure to reference the actual repo you’re contributing to e.g. “meshery-linkerd”).\n\nVerify the new remote named ‘upstream’\n\ngit remote -v\n\n\nWhenever you want to update your fork with the latest upstream changes, you’ll need to first fetch the upstream repo’s branches and latest commits to bring them into your repository:\n\nFetch from upstream remote\n\ngit fetch upstream\n\n\nView all branches, including those from upstream\n\ngit branch -va\n\n\nNow, check out your master branch and merge the upstream repo’s master branch:\n\nCheckout your master branch and merge upstream\n\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\n\n\nIf there are no unique commits on the local master branch, git will simply perform a fast-forward. However, if you have been making changes on master (in the vast majority of cases you probably shouldn’t be - see the next section, you may have to deal with conflicts. When doing so, be careful to respect the changes made upstream.\n\nNow, your local master branch is up-to-date with everything modified upstream.\n\nCreate a Branch (doing your work)\nWhenever you begin work on a new feature or bugfix, it’s important that you create a new branch. Not only is it proper git workflow, but it also keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch so that you can easily submit and manage multiple pull requests for every task you complete.\n\nTo create a new branch and start working on it, perform the following flow.\n\nCheck out the master branch - you want your new branch to come from the master\n\ngit checkout master\n\n\nCreate a new branch (give your branch its own simple informative name)\n\nFor enhancements use feature/your_username/issue# or feature/your_username/name_of_feature\n\nFor bugs use bug/your_username/issue# or bug/your_username/name_of_bug\n\ngit branch feature/jdoe/567\n\n\nSwitch to your new branch\n\ngit checkout feature/jdoe/567\n\n\nNow, go to town hacking away and making whatever changes you want to.\n\nSubmitting your changes (a Pull Request)\n\nBefore submitting your pull request, you might want to do a few things to clean up your branch and make it as simple as possible for the original repo’s maintainer to test, accept, and merge your work.\n\nIn the time that you’ve been working on your changes, if any commits have been made to the upstream master branch, you will need to rebase your development branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward that won’t require any conflict resolution work.\n\nFetch upstream master and merge with your repo’s master branch\n\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\n\n\nIf there were any new commits, rebase your development branch\n\ngit checkout feature/jdoe/567\ngit rebase master\n\n\nNow, it may be desirable to squash some of your smaller commits down into a small number of larger more cohesive commits. You can do this with an interactive rebase:\n\nRebase all commits on your development branch\n\ngit checkout\ngit rebase -i master\n\n\nThis will open up a text editor where you can specify which commits to squash.\n\nSubmitting\n\nOnce you’ve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it."

					"project-contributing-contributing-cli-guide": {
						"id": "project-contributing-contributing-cli-guide",
						"title": "Meshery CLI Contributing Guidelines",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide",
						"content": "These guidelines are a collection of principles and conventions that need to be followed while designing mesheryctl commands.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n**1. Consistency is quality.**\n\n- _Consistency of interaction drives a *quality* user experience. Whether that experience is delightful or painful is a related, but separate consideration. Meshery's behavior of user interactions should be consistent even when their user experience is poor._\n\n**2. Intuitive user experiences feel natural to users.**\n\n- _When being designed, each of Meshery's user experiences should be examined first from the user's perspective._\n\nCommands should be designed in such a way that they are intuitive. Users should ideally be able to understand what a command is used for without having to extensively go through the documentation.\n\nFor example, `mesheryctl design apply -f ` requires no further clarification as it is evident that the command will apply the pattern specified.\n\nConsistency is key when designing intuitive interfaces. Although `mesheryctl perf run -f ` may sound more intuitive, users who are experienced in using the CLI will prefer the consistent verb `apply` over `run`. This will also ensure a consistent command language making memorizing easier. Consistency should also be enforced when chaining commands and using flags.\n\nFor example, if `mesheryctl design` has a `list` and `view` command and has an `-all` and `--output` flag, then, similar commands like `mesheryctl perf` should also support the same commands and flags and provide a consistent user experience.\n\n### Rational defaults overridden with flags\n\nDefault behaviour should be optimised for what users will need to do most of the time.\n\nThese assumed defaults should be easily overridden by the user with flags.\n\nFor example, `mesheryctl system context create ` assumes a default platform for the created context. But this can be easily overridden with the `--platform` flag.\n\n### User Experience: GUI vs CLI\n\nIdeally, all functionality provided in Meshery UI should be available to users via CLI (in `mesherctl`). Meshery strives for parity of functionality between it's two clients. For example, viewing a performance profile in the GUI and with `mesheryctl system perf view ` in the CLI should show the same data.\n\nCommand line interfaces offer less context to the user, which makes them inherently less intuitive compared to graphical user interfaces. Both of these user interfaces, however, are the same in that they are both clients of Meshery Server. Both clients _are_ a user experience and as such, to be attended to in this way. The following considerations should be accounted for when designing `mesheryctl` experiences:\n\n- Provide only relevant output. Use \"debug\" logs that can be accessed with `--verbose` flag wherever needed.\n- Add headers to output to give context to the user.\n- As mentioned [above](#intuition-vs-consistency), similar commands should behave similarly.\n- Confirm steps for risky commands. For example, use the `AskForConfirmation` function which will prompt the user to type in \"yes\" or \"no\" to continue.\n- Anticipate user actions. If the user creates a new context with `mesheryctl system context create` then the next action might be `mesheryctl system start` to start Meshery ot `mesheryctl system context switch` to switch context names.\n- Anticipate user errors. For example, if the user types in `mesheryctl system satrt`, using the inbuilt features with the [cobra library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), we can correct it to `start` and alert the user.\n\n## Process\n\n### Contributor-facing Design Artifacts\n\nThe following table outlines a set of design artifacts produced in the process of creating and implementing functional specifications.\n\n| **Document** | **Purpose** |\n| [Meshery CLI Commands & Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#) | Overarching index of all mesheryctl commands |\n| [Meshery CLI Design Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iw88bZEL_fWeajxHh0BgmhuXGKl455P4CF-vm1yCkU8/edit#) - See [Creating a Functional Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RP3IWLc-MiQS-QYasqCoVuCH7--G87p5ezE5f_nOzB8/edit) | Breakout of individual command purpose, syntax, flags, and behavior. Links to these separate, breakout documents should be pasted into the Meshery CLI Commands & Documentation doc. |\n| [Mesheryctl Command Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q63sIGAuCnIeDs8PeM-0BAkNj8BBgPUXhLbe1Y-318o/edit#gid=0) | A spreadsheet of all commands, subcommands and flags with an indication of their implementation status would be most helpful for both documentation and planning purposes. |\n\n### User-facing Documentation Artifacts\n\nThe following table outlines a set of design artifacts produced in the process of creating and implementing functional specifications.\n\n| **Document** | **Purpose** |\n| [mesheryctl Command Reference](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) | Overarching index in the form of succinct, categorized, and tabularly displayed reference of all commands and their syntax with simple example usage. |\n| `mesheryctl ` | Breakout of individual command purpose, syntax, flags, and behavior. Links to these separate, breakout documents should be available from the mesheryctl Command Reference. |\n\n## When designing for the CLI, consider...\n\n### What the command does\n\nWhat makes sense to do from a terminal? What doesn’t?\nWhat might people want to automate?\nWhat is the default behavior? What flags might you need to change that behavior?\nWhat might people try and fail to do and how can you anticipate that?\n\n### What the command is called\n\nWhat should be the command language? (`mesheryctl   [args] [flags] [value]`)\nWhat should be a command vs a flag?\nHow can you align the language of the new command with the existing commands?\n\n### What the command outputs\n\nHow can you make the GUI and the CLI outputs similar?\nWhat should be outputted normally and what falls into debug logs?\n\n### How you explain your command\n\nYou will need to provide a short and long description of the command for the help pages and also for the Meshery Documentation.\n\n## Proposing new features / creating a design specification\n\nIf you are working on a new command or adding a new feature on an existing command, it is recommended to setup a design spec so that other contributors can weigh in on the design before you start to code.\n\nBroader features should have a design specification created in the form of a Google Doc. Refer to \"[Process: Creating a Functional Specification or other Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RP3IWLc-MiQS-QYasqCoVuCH7--G87p5ezE5f_nOzB8/edit?usp=sharing)\", which has detailed information on creating a design specification.\n\nFor small changes, communicating over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues) or the [discussions](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/discussions) will be helpful."

Each component provides granular and specific support for your infrastructure and applications. Once registered with Meshery Server (in the Registry), components are available for inclusion in Designs that you create. Components can be created and published by anyone, allowing you to share you custom extensions with the community.\n\nOverview of Steps to Create Components\n\nPrework:\n\n\n\n  Component Classification\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n  Component Definition\n  Component Customization\n\n\nPostwork:\n\n  Component Testing\n  Component Contribution\n\n\nPrework\n\n\n\n1. Understand Model Generation and Packaging\n\n\nPrerequisite Reading\nComponents are defined and packaged in context of a Model. Be sure to first read and understand how models are created and packaged before attempting to create a new component. Without a model defined first, they component will be homeless.\n\n\n\n\n2. Customize Component Form-based Representation\n\nEach component has any number of customizable properties in the form of metadata. The metadata provides additional details about the component, enhancing its capabilities. Metadata can be attached to components to customize their behavior. The metadata can be used to define the component’s behavior, appearance, and interactions with other components.\n\nCustomize Component Form-based Representation\n\nComponents optionally have a UI schema, which is a JSON object that describes how a form should be rendered. It can be passed to JSON forms and is categorized into controls or layouts. The UI schema object follows the form field hierarchy’s tree structure and defines how each property should be rendered. For example, it can specify the order of controls, their visibility, and the layout.\n\nSome UI schema elements have an options property that allows for further configuration of the rendering result. These configuration options are often renderer specific and need to be looked up. Some commonly used options include:\n\nui:order: An array of field names in the order in which they should appear\nui:widget: The name of an alternative widget to use for the field\nui:field: The name of a custom field\nclassNames: The class names to put on the component\n\nMeshery UI uses the react-jsonschema-form library to render forms. See the RJSF documentation for more information.\n\nCustomize Component Visual Representation\n\nMeshery contributors who want to customize the visual representation of a Meshery component can do so by modifying the component’s metadata. This metadata includes fields for specifying the component’s:\n\n\n  SVG: The SVG file used to represent the component visually.\n  Primary Color: The primary color used for the component in hex format.\n  Secondary Color: The secondary color used for the component in hex format.\n  Shape: The basic shape of the component, such as a circle or square.\n  isAnnotation: A boolean value that indicates whether the component is an annotation or is semantically meaningful.\n\n\n\nExample Component Metadata\n\n\"metadata\": {\n   \"capabilities\": \"\",\n   \"defaultData\": \"\",\n   \"genealogy\": \"\",\n   \"isAnnotation\": false,\n   \"isCustomResource\": false,\n   \"isModelAnnotation\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"isNamespaced\": false,\n   \"logoURL\": \"Created by Meshery Authors\",\n   \"model\": \"kubernetes\",\n   \"modelDisplayName\": \"Kubernetes\",\n   \"primaryColor\": \"#326CE5\",\n   \"secondaryColor\": \"#7aa1f0\",\n   \"shape\": \"round-rectangle\",\n   \"shapePolygonPoints\": \"\",\n   \"status\": \"enabled\",\n   \"styleOverrides\": \"{\\\"height\\\":\\\"22px\\\", \\\"width\\\":\\\"22px\\\", \\\"x\\\":\\\"8.5\\\", \\\"y\\\":\\\"7.5\\\"}\",\n   \"styles\": \"{\\\"height\\\":\\\"22px\\\", \\\"width\\\":\\\"22px\\\", \\\"x\\\":\\\"8.5\\\", \\\"y\\\":\\\"7.5\\\"}\",\n   \"subCategory\": \"\",\n   \"svgColor\": \"\\u003csvg width=\\\"90\\\" height=\\\"90\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 90 90\\\" fill=\\\"none\\\" xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\\"\\u003e\\n\\u003cpath fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" clip-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M41.0114 45.015C51.699 45.015 60.363 36.3512 60.363 25.6637C60.363 14.9763 51.699 6.3125 41.0114 6.3125C30.3239 6.3125 21.6599 14.9763 21.6599 25.6637C21.6599 36.3512 30.3239 45.015 41.0114 45.015ZM26.9841 46.0338C27.3733 45.9771 27.7668 46.0783 28.0996 46.2881C31.5844 48.484 36.0555 49.8036 40.931 49.8036C45.8346 49.8036 50.3289 48.4688 53.8223 46.2502C54.148 46.0434 54.5325 45.9405 54.9151 45.9897C64.2686 47.1911 71.4966 55.1832 71.4966 64.8635V72.3594C71.4966 78.7567 66.3106 83.9428 59.9132 83.9428H22.308C15.9107 83.9428 10.7246 78.7567 10.7246 72.3594V64.8635C10.7246 55.2946 17.7872 47.3752 26.9841 46.0338Z\\\" fill=\\\"#326CE5\\\"/\\u003e\\n\\u003cpath fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" clip-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M72.0356 82.4937C73.7201 80.3512 74.7249 77.649 74.7249 74.7122V64.0123C74.7249 55.9577 70.1245 48.9776 63.408 45.5561C72.7393 47.0963 79.8167 54.6562 79.7238 63.5783V72.0106C79.7238 76.766 76.5504 80.8211 72.0356 82.4937ZM63.6189 25.6633C63.6189 30.5769 62.1331 35.1434 59.5862 38.9381C66.2233 36.7133 71.0055 30.4442 71.0055 23.0581C71.0055 13.8103 63.5088 6.31348 54.261 6.31348C54.0822 6.31348 53.904 6.31628 53.7266 6.32184C59.7194 10.6542 63.6189 17.7034 63.6189 25.6633Z\\\" fill=\\\"#326CE5\\\"/\\u003e\\n\\u003c/svg\\u003e\\n\",\n   \"svgComplete\": \"\",\n   \"svgWhite\": \"\\u003csvg width=\\\"90\\\" height=\\\"90\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 90 90\\\" fill=\\\"none\\\" xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\\"\\u003e\\n\\u003cpath fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" clip-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M41.0114 45.015C51.699 45.015 60.363 36.3512 60.363 25.6637C60.363 14.9763 51.699 6.3125 41.0114 6.3125C30.3239 6.3125 21.6599 14.9763 21.6599 25.6637C21.6599 36.3512 30.3239 45.015 41.0114 45.015ZM26.9841 46.0338C27.3733 45.9771 27.7668 46.0783 28.0996 46.2881C31.5844 48.484 36.0555 49.8036 40.931 49.8036C45.8346 49.8036 50.3289 48.4688 53.8223 46.2502C54.148 46.0434 54.5325 45.9405 54.9151 45.9897C64.2686 47.1911 71.4966 55.1832 71.4966 64.8635V72.3594C71.4966 78.7567 66.3106 83.9428 59.9132 83.9428H22.308C15.9107 83.9428 10.7246 78.7567 10.7246 72.3594V64.8635C10.7246 55.2946 17.7872 47.3752 26.9841 46.0338Z\\\" fill=\\\"white\\\"/\\u003e\\n\\u003cpath fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" clip-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M72.0356 82.4937C73.7201 80.3512 74.7249 77.649 74.7249 74.7122V64.0123C74.7249 55.9577 70.1245 48.9776 63.408 45.5561C72.7393 47.0963 79.8167 54.6562 79.7238 63.5783V72.0106C79.7238 76.766 76.5504 80.8211 72.0356 82.4937ZM63.6189 25.6633C63.6189 30.5769 62.1331 35.1434 59.5862 38.9381C66.2233 36.7133 71.0055 30.4442 71.0055 23.0581C71.0055 13.8103 63.5088 6.31348 54.261 6.31348C54.0822 6.31348 53.904 6.31628 53.7266 6.32184C59.7194 10.6542 63.6189 17.7034 63.6189 25.6633Z\\\" fill=\\\"white\\\"/\\u003e\\n\\u003c/svg\\u003e\\n\"\n  },\n\n\n\nContributors can also override these settings for individual components if needed.

Include the following attributes in your relationship definition:\n\n\n  kind: The genre of component (e.g., Pod).\n  model: The model to which the component belongs (e.g., kubernetes).\n  version: The version of the component definition (e.g., v1.0.0).\n  description: A characterization of the component, its purpose and behavior.\n\n\n\nUse Existing Components as Examples\nBrowse the existing components in the Meshery repository to find examples of how to existing component, using them as a template.\n\n\nPostwork\n\n\n\n4. Component Authoring Best Practices and Considerations\n\nGeneral\n\n\n  Use camelCasing as the formatting convention.\n  Increment the component definition using the version property with each change published.\n\n\n\n\n5. Contribute your component to the Meshery project\n\nSubmit a pull request to the Meshery repository with your new component definition, so that all users can benefit from the component(s) you have defined.\n\nKeeping your component definition in a separate file allows for easier management and review of the component(s) you have defined.\n\n\nKeeping your custom Components private\nAlternatively, if you would like to keep the component definition private, you can bundle your component(s) in a custom model, import the custom model into your Meshery deployment. Your private component definition(s) will be registered in your Meshery Server's registry and available for use within your Meshery deployment."

These are used to classify the nature of interaction between one or more interconnected Components.\n\nOverview of Steps to Create Relationships\n\nPrework:\n\n\n  Relationship Identification\n  Relationship Classification\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n  Relationship Definition\n  Relationship Scopes\n\n\nPostwork:\n\n  Relationship Testing\n  Relationship Contribution\n\n\nPrework\n\n\n\n1. Characterize the relationship and any specific constraints\n\nUsing your domain expertise, define the qualities of this new relationship. Identify and qualify any specific constraints to be enforced between one or more specific components within the same or different models. Let’s take an example to understand this better.\n\nFor example, you might know that a Kubernetes Service can have a network-based relatinship with a Kubernetes Pod. To codify this relationship, you would define the relationship as a kind: edge relationship with a type: network.\n\n\nRelationship Example\n\n{\n  \"schemaVersion\": \"core.meshery.io/v1alpha2\",\n  \"kind\": \"edge\",\n  \"type\": \"network\",\n  \"version\": \"v1.0.0\",\n  \"metadata\": {\"description\": \"A relationship that defines network edges between components.\"}\n  selector: [{\n      \"allow\": {\n         \"from\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Service\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"to\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\"\n            }\n         ]\n      },\n      \"deny\": {}\n   }]\n\n\n\n\nYou might also know that this relationship is constrained by the presence of a Kubernetes Deployment as the parent of the Kubernetes Pod. This constraint would be codified in the relationship definition by including the deny function in your selector.\n\n\nExample Relationship with Constraints\n\nselector: [\n   {\n      \"allow\": {\n         \"from\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Service\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"to\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\"\n            }\n         ]\n      },\n      \"deny\": {\n         \"from\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Service\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"to\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\",\n               \"parent\": \"Deployment\"\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n]\n\n\n\nCodify relationships leveraging your domain expertise. In this example, the relationship between the Service and Pod components in the Kubernetes model is defined with appropriate consideration of surrounding constraints (e.g. presence of a Deployment).\n\nUnderstand Relationship Classifications\n\nRelationships can be classified into three main categories:\n\n\n  \n    Hierarchical relationships involve either an ancestral connection of the components i.e. the creation/ deletion of a Component higher up affects the existence of the Components below in the lineage or a connection that involves the inheritance of features from one Component to the other.\n\n    \n      Parent: A parent-child relationship implies the requirement of the parent component before the child component can be created. For example, a Namespace in Kubernetes can be a parent of Pods within that namespace. The namespace must exist before creating pods within it.\n      Inventory: A hierarchical inventory relationship implies the configuration of a(parent) component is patched with the configuration of other (child) component. For example, Wasm filters can inherit features and functionalities from Envoy filters. This can be used to build on existing functionalities provided by Envoy filters and further extend them using Wasm filters. It enables a modular and scalable approach to customize the behavior of the proxy while maintaining a clear hierarchy of features.\n    \n  \n  \n    Edge relationships indicate the possibility of traffic flow between two components. They enable communication and interaction between different Components within the system.\n\n    \n      Mount: This subtype addresses the storage and access possibility between involved components. For example, a PersistentVolume can be mounted to a Pod to provide persistent storage for the pod’s data.\n      Network: This deals with IP addresses and DNS names and provides stable endpoints for communication. For example, a Service provides a stable endpoint for accessing multiple replicas of a Deployment.\n      Firewall: This acts as an intermediary for communications which include standard networking protocols like TCP and UDP. It can enforce network policies to control traffic between components. For example, a NetworkPolicy can be used to manage the traffic flow between different Pods in the cluster.\n      Permission: This defines the permissions for components if they can have a possible relationship with other Components. It ensures that only authorized Components can interact with each other. For example, a Role can define permissions for Components to access specific resources.\n    \n  \n  \n    Sibling relationships represent connections between components that are at the same hierarchical level or share a common parent. Siblings can have the same or similar functionalities or may interact with each other in specific ways. These relationships facilitate communication and cooperation between components that are in the same group or category. For example, a Service and a Pod in Kubernetes are siblings as they share a common parent and are at the same hierarchical level.\n  \n\n\n\n\n2. Classify relationship type and specify visual representation\n\nBrowse and pick the most appropriate visualization for this relationship by using one of the predefined relationship visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n    Example Visual Representations\n    Kind: Hierarchical\n        \n            subType: Parent | Namespace (Parent) and ConfigMap (child), Role (Child) (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            subType: Inventory | Namespace and ConfigMap (open in playground)\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    Kind: Edge\n        \n            Type: `Non-Binding`, subType: `Permission`: Cluster Role with Cluster Role Binding to Service Account (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n            Type: `Binding`, subType: `Mount`: Pod to Persistent volume via Persistent volume claim (open in playground) \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            Type: `Non-Binding`, subType: `Network`: Ingress to Service (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            Type: `Non-Binding`, subType: `Network`: Service to Pod (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            Type: `Non-Binding`, subType: `Network`: Service to Service (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            Type: `Non-Binding`, subType: `Network`: Service to Endpoint (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            Type: `Non-Binding`, subType: `Network`: Service to Deployment (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            type:non-binding, subType: `Network`: Network Policy (Pod to Pod)  (open in playground)\n        \n        \n        \n    \n\nOnce selected, note the relationship’s kind, type, and subtype of your selected visualization. Alternatively, if an existing visualization does not seem appropriate for the relationship, please propose a new visualization at-will. Simply use the whiteboard feature of Meshery’s extensions to sketch out the relationship and propose it as a new visualization.\n\nDevelopment\n\n\n\n3. Create a Relationship Definition as a JSON file\n\nCreate a relationship definition as a JSON file, placing this new definition file into its respective model folder (see Contributing to Models). Relationship definition files are commonly named  relationships.yaml as a convention, however, this name is not required. A model may include any number of relationship definitions. Include the following attributes in your relationship definition:\n\n\n  kind: The genre of relationship (e.g., hierarchical, edge, sibling).\n  type: The augmentative category of the relationship (e.g., binding, non-binding, inventory).\n  subType: The specific representative visual paradigm (e.g., parent, mount, network, wallet, badge).\n  selectors: The scope of the relationship, including the components involved and any constraints. Selector specify to which component(s) the relationship applies or does not apply (think of in terms of the AND operators in a query). Selector Sets are used to combine multiple selectors for more granular control over the logic used when matchmaking (establishing a relationship) between components (think of in terms of the OR operators in a query).\n  evaluationQuery: Name of the policy or policies (Open Policy Agent rego file(s)) to invoke for relationship evaluation. Identify an existing OPA policy as the evaluationQuery suitable to the relationship. If no policy exists, propose a new policy (rego). (rarely necessary) Create a new policy for the evaluation of your relationship using Rego. This step is only necessary and can typically be skipped. Contact a maintainer if the relationship requires a new policy to evaluate the relationship.\n  description: A characterization of the relationship, its purpose, and any constraints or considerations of its application.\n\n\n\nUse Existing Relationships as Examples\nBrowse the existing relationships in the Meshery repository to find examples of how to existing relationships, using them as a template. Alternatively, you can review a prior pull request as an example as well, for example PR #9880.\n\n\n\n\n4. Configuring the Scope of Relationships\n\nThe extent to which a relationship affects components within a model or beyond a model is defined and controlled using scopes. Scopes exist at two levels in Meshery relationships.\n\nGlobal Scope\n\nGlobal scope is defined using the model and version attributes in the relationship definition.\n\nRelationships can be confined to a specific model, a specific model version, or can be allowed to affect all models. The relationship schema has a model and version attribute which facilitates this control. For example, if the model is specified as aws-ec2-controller, the relationship will work for those components that belong to the aws-ec2-controller model.\n\nLocal Scope\n\nLocal scope is defined and controlled via selectors attributes in the relationship definition.\n\nRelationship selectors refine the scope of applicability the relationship. It is the details included within the Selector that determines whether there is a match and relationship to be formed. These details include which models and components are involved in the relationship and any constraints in its formation. Selector specify to which component(s) the relationship applies or does not apply (think of in terms of the AND operators in a query). Selector Sets are used to combine multiple selectors for more granular control over the logic used when matchmaking (establishing a relationship) between components (think of in terms of the OR operators in a query).\n\n\n\nSelectors are structured as an array wherein each entry comprises a from (self) property and a to (others) property. The from and to combined with the allow and deny properties delineate between components involved in a particular relationship. These entries define the constraints necessary for the existence of a relationship, thus scoping a relationship. Each item in the selector uniquely defines a relation between the components listed. i.e. from and to fields are evaluated within the context of the selector.\n\nOnly the components within the same selector relate to each other via 1:many kind of relation between components listed inside the from and to field. i.e. Each object inside the from relates to each item inside the two field within a particular selector.\n\nWhen defining relationships that involve a large number of combinations between from and to, selectors sets provide a mechanism to organize and manage these relationships. This prevents the need for crafting complex deny attributes and facilitates easier maintenance. Use of selector sets enhances flexibility and reusability in the definition and configuration of relationships among components.\n\nNote: When defining Hierarchical relationships, remember that the from field represents the child component, while the to field represents the parent component.\n\n\nRelationship Selector Example\n\n\nselector: [\n   {\n      \"allow\": {\n         \"from\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"WASMFilter\",\n               \"model\": \"istio-base\",\n               \"patch\": {\n                  \"patchStrategy\": \"replace\",\n                  \"mutatorRef\": [\n                     [\n                        \"settings\",\n                        \"config\"\n                     ],\n                     [\n                        \"settings\",\n                        \"wasm-filter\"\n                     ]\n                  ],\n                  \"description\": \"WASM filter configuration to be applied to Envoy Filter.\"\n               }\n            },\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"EBPFFilter\",\n   .....\n            }\n         ],\n         \"to\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"EnvoyFilter\",\n               \"model\": \"istio-base\",\n               \"patch\": {\n                  \"patchStrategy\": \"replace\",\n                  \"mutatedRef\": [\n                     [\n                        \"settings\",\n                        \"configPatches\",\n                        \"_\",\n                        \"patch\",\n                        \"value\"\n                     ]\n                  ],\n                  \"description\": \"Receive the WASM filter configuration.\"\n               }\n            },\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"WASMPlugin\",\n   ....\n            }\n   ...\n         ]\n      },\n      \"deny\": {\n   ...\n      }\n   },\n   {\n      \"allow\": {\n         \"from\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"ConfigMap\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\",\n               \"patch\": {\n                  \"patchStrategy\": \"replace\",\n                  \"mutatorRef\": [\n                     [\n                        \"name\"\n                     ]\n                  ],\n                  \"description\": \"In Kubernetes, ConfigMaps are a versatile resource that can be referenced by various other resources to provide configuration data to applications or other Kubernetes resources.\\n\\nBy referencing ConfigMaps in these various contexts, you can centralize and manage configuration data more efficiently, allowing for easier updates, versioning, and maintenance of configurations in a Kubernetes environment.\"\n               }\n            }\n         ],\n         \"to\": [\n            {\n               \"kind\": \"Deployment\",\n               \"model\": \"kubernetes\",\n               \"patch\": {\n                  \"patchStrategy\": \"replace\",\n                  \"mutatedRef\": [\n                     [\n                        \"spec\",\n                        \"containers\",\n                        \"_\",\n                        \"envFrom\",\n                        \"configMapRef\",\n                        \"name\"\n                     ]\n                  ],\n                  \"description\": \"Deployments can reference ConfigMaps to inject configuration data into the Pods they manage.

This ensures independence in how these components relate to each other while still permitting similar types of relationships.\n\nThis example relationship demonstrates how the `WASMFilter` and `EBPFFilter` components identified in `from` relate to other `EnvoyFilter` `WASMPlugin` components identified in `to` selector. Similarly, `ConfigMap` component identified in the `from` selector corresponds to each `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, and so on component identified in the `to` selector.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Relationship Policies and their Evaluation\n\nThe evaluationQuery property in your relationship definition is used to identity the name of the policy to be used by Meshery’s evaluation engine. Meshery embeds Open Policy Agent as it’s policy engine\n\nHow should you determine the value for evaluationQuery\n\nAll relationship definitions are backed by OPA policies and each relationship depends on their kind, type, and subType in order to be properly evaluated. Which evaluation policy or set of policies used during the evaluation moment is defined by the evaluationQuery property, which follows the naming convention of combining each of their  kind, type, and subType  properties with an underscore and the word “_relationship”, like so: kind_type_subtype_relationship.\n\nSo, for example, if you are defining or updating a relationship definition with kind: edge and type: network, the value for the attribute evaluationQuery should be edge_network_relationship.\n\nEach policy has a set of evaluation rules defined and the evaluationQuery attribute corresponds to the main rule defined inside the policy, during the policy eval the results are collected from this rule.\n\nPostwork\n\n\n\nRelationship Authoring Best Practices and Considerations\n\nGeneral\n\n\n  Use camelCasing as the formatting convention.\n\n\nScoping\n\n\n  To configure a relationship to be applied across models, ensure the model property for those relationships is set to *, to limit the relationships to a specific model, specify the correct model(case sensitive).\n  To configure a relationship to be applied across all versions of a particular model, ensure the version property for those relationships is set to *, to limit the relationships to a specific version of a model, specify the correct model version.\n  Specify version property as a regex to ensure relationships are applied to a subset of versions of a model.\n\n\nActions\n\n\n  If a path mutatedRef/mutatorRef contains more than one array path then only the first array position can be specified as \\_ for others explicitly mention them as 0\n  Currently mutatedRef doesn’t support having an array.\n\n\nMatching\n\n\n  Targets of a Relationship can be specific Components or entire Models.\n  Values for propoerties like kind, version, and model are case-sensitive.\n  Absence of a property in the selector is interpretted as the wildcard *.\n    \n      For example, a selector with kind: Pod, Model: Kubernetes, and the absence of the version property would be interpretted as version: *, which\nmeans that all the versions of the Kubernetes Pod resource (k8s.io/v1/betav2) will match the selector.\n    \n  \n  The evaluationQuery property determines the OPA policy to invoke for relationship evaluation, specify the correct rego query.\n\n\nConflicts\n\n\n  Ensure that the deny selectors and allow selectors do not conflict with each other i.e. relations are not getting overlapped for allow and deny selectors.\n  In the event of conflicting Relationship Definitions, the union between them is taken.\n    \n      If we have two Relationships, one from (Component A) to (Component B and Component F), and another\nfrom (Component A) to (Component B and Component C), then it is similar to having a Relationship\nfrom Component A to Component B, C and F\n    \n  \n  In the event of an overlapping set of complementary Relationship Definitions, Union.\n  In the event of an overlapping set of conflicting Relationship Definitions, no relationship type (Kind) is inherently more important than the next one, so will not be any case of conflict.\n\n\n\n\n4. Contribute your relationship to the Meshery project\n\nSubmit a pull request to the Meshery repository with your new relationship definition, so that all users can benefit from the relationship(s) you have defined.\n\nKeeping your relationship definition in a separate file allows for easier management and review of the relationship(s) you have defined.\n\n\nKeeping your custom Relationships private\nAlternatively, if you would like to keep the relatioship definition private, you can bundle your relatinship(s) in a custom model, import the custom model into your Meshery deployment. Your private relationship definition(s) will be registered in your Meshery Server's registry and available for use within your Meshery deployment.\n\n\nFor more information refer - Model - Construct Models in Meshery"

Models are defined in JSON and can be used to visualize the components and relationships between them. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new model.\n\nMeshery Components are the building blocks of a model. Each component represents a different part of the system or application. Components can be anything from a database to a microservice to a server. Relationships define how components interact with each other. For example, a database component might have a relationship with a microservice component that represents the microservice’s dependency on the database.\n\nCreating your first Meshery Model\n\nThe following instructions are a no-fluff guide to creating your own Meshery Models quickly.

						"content": "Understanding the internals of Meshery’s logical object model\n\nMeshery’s internal object model is designed to provide a consistent and extensible way of capturing and characterizing the resources under Meshery’s management and the capabilities Meshery has at its disposal. Meshery Models serve as the unit of packaging for the object models that define a registered capability or a type of managed infrastructure and their relationships, and details specifics of how to manage them.Models often represent infrastructure and application technologies, however, they are also capable of defining other types of entities like annotations, like shapes (infrastructure ambiguous components). Models are used to define the capabilities of Meshery. See Models to learn more about models as a logical concept.\n\nEach model includes a set of entities (in the form of definitions) that Meshery can manage. Models are defined and versioned using on the Model Schema. The schema defines the structure of the model, including the entities it contains, their relationships, and the properties they have. The schema also defines the version of the model and the version of the schema itself. See Registry to learn more about Meshery’s internal registry and how to use it.\n\n\nFigure: Model Entity Classification\n\nMeshery Entities and their Lifecycle\n\nThis section aids in your understanding of the vernacular of Meshery’s internal object model and discusses the difference beteween schemas, definitions, declarations, and instances. The lifecycle of Meshery entities (components, relationships, policies) is represented by the following terms, which are used to describe the various stages of their lifecycle.\n\nSchema\n\nSchema (static) : the skeletal structure representing a logical view of the size, shape, characteristics of a construct.\n\nThe schema represents the skeletal structure of an entity and provides a logical view of its size, shape, and characteristics. It defines the expected properties and attributes of the entity. The schema serves as a blueprint or template for creating instances of the entity. It is a static representation that defines the structure and properties but does not contain specific configuration values.\n\n\nSchema example\nComponent schema excerpt {\n\"$id\": \"https://schemas.meshery.io/component.json\",\n  \"$schema\": \"&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;\",\n\"description\": \"Components are the atomic units for designing infrastructure. Learn more at &lt;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/components&gt;\",\n\"required\": [\n\"apiVersion\",\n\"kind\",\n\"schema\",\n\"model\"\n],\n\"additionalProperties\": false,\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"apiVersion\": {\n\"type\": \"string\",\n\"description\": \"API Version of the component.\"\n},\n\"kind\": {\n\"type\": \"string\",\n\"description\": \"Kind of the component.\"\n.\n.\n.\n\n See github.com/meshery/schemas for more details.\n\n\nDefinition\n\nDefinition (static) : An implementation of the Schema containing an outline of the specific attributes of a given, unconfigured entity.\n\nA definition is an implementation of the schema. It contains specific configurations and values for the entity at hand. The definition provides the actual configuration details for a specific instance of the entity. It is static because it is created based on the schema but does not change once created. The definition is used to instantiate declarations of the entity.\n\n\nDefinition example\na generic, unconfigured Kubernetes Pod.\n\n\nDeclaration\n\nDeclaration (static) : - A configured entity with detailed intentions of a given Definition.\n\n\nDeclaration example\nNGINX container as a Kubernetes Pod with port 443 and SSL termination.\n\n\nInstance\n\nInstance (dynamic) : A realized entity (deployed/discovered); An instantiation of the declaration.\n\nAn instance represents a realized entity. An instance is a dynamic representation that corresponds to a deployed or discovered instantiation of a declaration. An instance is created based on its corresponding definition and represents an actual running or deployed version of the entity within the environment.\n\n\nInstance example\nNGINX-as234z2 pod running in a cluster as a Kubernetes Pod with port 443 and SSL termination.\n\n\nInstructions for creating a new Model\n\n\nCreating Models Quick Start\nSee the quick start for a no fluff guide to creating your first Meshery model.\n\n\nAll of Meshery’s Models, Components, and Relationships can be found in the Meshery Integrations spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is the source of truth for the definition of Meshery’s models. On a daily schedule, the contents of the Meshery Integrations spreadsheet is refreshed.\n\n\nModel Source Code\nSee examples of Models defined in JSON in meshery/meshery.\n\n\nTo add or update a model, follow these steps:\n\n\n  Create a Model Definition. Open the Meshery Integrations spreadsheet. Create a new row (or comment to suggest a new row) to capture the specific details of your model. As you fill-in model details, referernce each column’s notes and comments as instructions and an explanation of their purpose.\n  Generate Components. Once you have entered values into the required columns, either execute step 2.a. or 2.b.\n    \n      Execute the following command to generate components for your model.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n$ mesheryctl registry generate --spreadsheet-id &quot;1DZHnzxYWOlJ69Oguz4LkRVTFM79kC2tuvdwizOJmeMw&quot; --spreadsheet-cred “$&quot;\n\n\n\n  Ask a maintainer to invoke the Model Generator workflow.\n  Enhance Component details. While the default shape for new components is a circle, each component should be considered for its best-fit shape.\n  Review and familiarize with the available set of predefined relationship types. Refer to the Cytoscape node types for a list of possible shapes.\n  Propose a specific shape, best-suited to visually represent the Component. Example - Deployment as a pentagon.\n  Proposee a specific icon, best-suited to visually represent the Component. Example - DaemonSet as a skull icon.\n\n\n\nUsing Meshery CLI with the Registry (models)\nCreate new and list existing models by using mesheryctl registry to interact with the Meshery Registry and the Meshery Integrations spreadsheet.\n\n\nInstructions for creating a new Component\n\nSee the Contributing to Components for detailed instructions.\n\nInstructions for creating a new Relationship\n\nSee the Contributing to Relationships for detailed instructions.\n\n\nGenerating Models does not require Meshery Server\nMeshery Server is not required to generate models. The Meshery CLI can be used to generate models. Model and Component generation logic is MeshKit. `mesheryctl` and Meshery Server both utilize MeshKit’s libraries for ongoing programmatic generation of models and components.\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe Meshery team is currently working on the following:\n\n\n  Extending the model to support additional entities\n  Improving the tooling for working with models\n  Defining relationships between components and embedding those policies within models\n\n\nWe encourage you to get involved in the development of Meshery Models and to share your feedback.\n\n\nMeshery Models are extensible\nMeshery Models are designed to be extensible, allowing you to define new components as needed.

						"content": "Background\nMeshery has a built-in policy engine, based on Open Policy Agent (OPA). Meshery uses the Rego query language to create these policies.\n\nPrerequisites\nTo start contributing to Meshery Policy Engine, make sure you have OPA CLI installed on your system. You will also need to clone the Meshery Server project from Github.\n\nComponents of Meshery Policy Engine\n\nRego policies are the declarative logic behind the policy engine. These policies define how the underlying engine understands relationships within Meshery Designs. Rego policies can be found here in the Meshery Github repository.\n\nCurrently the Rego policies are invoked from the Go code in Meshery Server. This requires configuring the OPA context as seen here.\n\nThe Meshery Policy Engine is invoked by calling the evaluation endpoint. This endpoint is passed a Meshery Design in JSON which it passes to the Meshery Policy Engine for validation.\n\nWorking with Meshery Policy Engine\n\nWorking with the Meshery Policy Engine can feel complex because of the large number of different relationships a Meshery Design might contain. Contributors must then be careful to test any changes thoroughly to avoid unexpected results. When working with the Rego policies themselves it makes testing and development easier to be able to test the policies directly without running the entire Meshery Server. When working on the policies keep the following in mind:\n\n\n  Since we will be running these policies using the OPA CLI directly without the Go bootstrap code we need to provide the necessary context for the policy engine. This means providing a data structure containing the valid Meshery Relationships the policy engine will evaluate against.\n  The input to the policy engine is a Meshery Design as a JSON data structure. When testing the Meshery Policy Engine you will need to provide this design as input. If you are working on a bug you will need to get the design from the issue or directly from the individual who reported the bug.\n\n\nExecuting OPA\n\nYou can evaluate the Rego policies against test data stored in the policies/test folder:\n\n\n\nmake rego-eval"

It ensures that users are kept in the loop regarding the ongoing activities within the API, and guides users towards future steps to resolve issues. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on sending events from the server, including when to trigger events and what information to include.\n\n\nFirst, let's take a look at how the event object is constructed,\n\n\n \n eventBuilder := events.NewEvent()\n                  .ActedUpon(UUID)\n                  .FromUser(UUID)\n                  .FromSystem(UUID)\n                  .WithCategory(string)\n                  .WithAction(string)\n                  .WithSeverity(EventSeverity)\n                  .WithDescription(string)\n                  .WithMetadata(map[string]interface{})\n                  .Build()\n  \n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n*Note: `events` is a package [github.com/meshery/meshkit/models/events](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit) from MeshKit containing source code of event related functionality*\n\nThe event mechanism utilizes [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to construct event objects, `events.NewEvent()` creates an instance of [EventBuilder](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit/blob/ea3c60907a1cd1902902a4113206579992772083/models/events/build.go#L9) type, which functions as a builder class for constructing [Event](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit/blob/ea3c60907a1cd1902902a4113206579992772083/models/events/events.go#L37) objects. \n\n- `ActedUpon(UUID)` : it takes [UUID](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gofrs/uuid#UUID) of the resource being provisioned on the server, and the events are associated with that resource.\n- `FromUser()` : it takes [UUID](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gofrs/uuid#UUID) of the user initiating the HTTP request to the server. This enables the server to publish events intended for that specific user in response.\n- `FromSystem(UUID)` : it takes [UUID](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gofrs/uuid#UUID) of the running meshery instance (Handler instance contains it [`h.SystemID`](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/c73d3687da3eb3b2aaaabbd27e91f99906fc5838/server/handlers/handler_instance.go#L29)).\n- `WithCategory` : The string argument to specify under which category this event falls, For example, when a user is provisioning a Kubernetes connection, the specified category for the event is \"connection.\n- `WithAction` : The string argument to specify the type of action the server is performing, for instance, when registering a Kubernetes connection, the action would be \"register\".\n\n*Note: categories and actions must be in snake case,*\n      example categories: **\"signup_request\", \"github_artifacts\"**.\n      example actions: **\"remove_from_organization\", \"add_to_organization\"**.\n\n- `WithSeverity`: it takes [EventSeverity](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit/blob/ea3c60907a1cd1902902a4113206579992772083/models/events/events.go#L75) (underlying type is string), to specify severity of the event to bring user's attention to the event accordingly.\n\n*Note: In certain conditions you must add some fields with specific  keys:*\n- If the severity is \"Error\", include a field in Metadata using the key `err` with the corresponding error value.\n- When you want to add a link to meshery docs, include a field in Metadata using the key `doc` with the corresponding link value.\n\n- `WithDescription` : The string argument provides a detailed, descriptive message that depicts the specific operation or action being executed on the server.\n- `WithMetadata`: it takes a Map `map[string]interface{}` data structure containing any supplementary information that the developer/contributor deems essential for the user to be informed about.\n- `Build` : returns the [Event](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit/blob/ea3c60907a1cd1902902a4113206579992772083/models/events/events.go#L37) instance constructed upon the previously described functions and prepares it for publication through the [Broadcast](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/1b5d78ed34648e0a91df8c2273026b930f748fbc/server/models/event_broadcast.go#L14), which is responsible for disseminating events.\n\n\n\n## An Example in Code\n\n\n \nfunc (h *Handler) KubernetesPingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, _ *models.Preference, user *models.User, provider models.Provider) {\n\tuserID := uuid.FromStringOrNil(user.ID)\n\ttoken, ok := req.Context().Value(models.TokenCtxKey).(string)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"failed to get the token for the user\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tconnectionID := req.URL.Query().Get(\"connection_id\")\n\teventBuilder := events.NewEvent().FromUser(userID).FromSystem(*h.SystemID).WithCategory(\"connection\").WithAction(\"ping\")\n\tif connectionID != \"\" {\n\t\t// Get the context associated with this ID\n\t\tk8sContext, err := provider.GetK8sContext(token, connectionID)\n\t\teventBuilder.ActedUpon(uuid.FromStringOrNil(connectionID))\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\teventBuilder.WithSeverity(events.Error).WithDescription(fmt.Sprintf(\"Encountered an issue while retrieving kubernetes context for connection ID `%s`\", connectionID)).\n\t\t\tWithMetadata(map[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\t\t\"error\": err,\n\t\t\t})\n\t\t\tevent := eventBuilder.Build()\n\t\t    _ = provider.PersistEvent(event)\n\t\t    go h.config.EventBroadcaster.Publish(userID, event)\n\t\t\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\t\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"failed to get kubernetes context for the given ID\")\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t\teventBuilder.WithSeverity(events.Success).WithDescription(\"Retrieved kubernetes context successfully\").\n\t\tWithMetadata(map[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\t\"Context Name\":   k8sContext.Name,\n\t\t\t\"Server Address\": k8sContext.Server,\n\t\t})\n\t\tevent := eventBuilder.Build()\n\t\t_ = provider.PersistEvent(event)\n\t\tgo h.config.EventBroadcaster.Publish(userID, event)\n\n\t\t// Remaining code ...\n    }\n}\n \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nIn the given code block, the \"resource\" refers to the connection on which the server is performing the \"ping\" action. The \"ActedUpon\" field is supplied with the \"connectionID\" value obtained from the query parameter. `provider.GetK8sContext` returns the [K8sContext](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/995ab671a12013088f874430cfa2c0f025b073d2/server/models/k8s_context.go#L26) object which serves as a representation of a Kubernetes context within the Meshery. if `provider.GetK8sContext` returns an error, the event is constructed with severity [Error](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit/blob/ea3c60907a1cd1902902a4113206579992772083/models/events/events.go#L18), description and enriched with metadata fields to provide the user with a complete context about the event.\n\nIf `provider.GetK8sContext` succeeds, an event with a [Success](https://github.com/meshery/meshkit/blob/ea3c60907a1cd1902902a4113206579992772083/models/events/events.go#L21) severity level is constructed. The event includes a success message and metadata containing the context name and the address of the Kubernetes API server, obtained from the operation. This information aims to provide users with relevant details about the successful operation.\n\nafter constructing the Event object using the Build function, event is stored into database for records and subsequently published in a new goroutine through [EventBroadcaster](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/995ab671a12013088f874430cfa2c0f025b073d2/server/models/handlers.go#L241) member variable of [HandlerConfig](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/995ab671a12013088f874430cfa2c0f025b073d2/server/models/handlers.go#L206), which is part of [Handler](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/995ab671a12013088f874430cfa2c0f025b073d2/server/handlers/handler_instance.go#L18) instance.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding and examine events more closely, you can explore the source code files [k8config_handler.go](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/server/handlers/k8sconfig_handler.go) and [design_engine_handler.go](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/server/handlers/design_engine_handler.go) within the Meshery project's codebase.\n\n\n## Sending Events to Meshery Server\n\nMeshery has two primary clients: Mesheryctl and Meshery UI. Both clients will produce multiple events throughout their lifecycle. Meshery Server is designed to accept these client-generated events and broadcast them using the [Broadcaster](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/1b5d78ed34648e0a91df8c2273026b930f748fbc/server/models/event_broadcast.go#L14).\n\nClients can send HTTP POST requests to [`api/events`](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/rest-apis#api-events) with the event encapsulated in a JSON request body. Upon receiving an event, the server processes, validates, and broadcasts it using the Broadcaster. This ensures that all relevant events generated by Mesheryctl and Meshery UI are effectively communicated and managed by the Meshery Server.\n\n### Example \n\n```javascript\nasync function sendClientEvent(clientId, eventPayload) {\n    // Create a new event\n    const event = {\n        category: \"client_event\",\n        action: \"create\",\n        severity: \"info\",\n        description: \"Client event creation\",\n        metadata: eventPayload\n    };\n\n    try {\n        // Send event to Meshery Server\n        const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9081/api/events', {\n            method: 'POST',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify(event)\n        });\n\n        if (!response.ok) {\n            throw new Error(`Server returned non-200 status: ${response.status}`);\n        }\n\n        console.log('Event sent successfully');\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to send event:', error);\n    }\n}\n\nsendClientEvent(clientId, eventPayload);"

						"content": "Prerequisite Reading\n  Contributing to Meshery UI\n\n\nContributing to Meshery UI - Notification Center\n\n\n  \n Your browser does not support the video tag\n\n\nThe NotificationCenter component of Meshery UI Switching to Graphql subscriptions and implementing robust filtering. Events are persisted in Meshery Server and state management on client is done using Redux Toolkit and RTK.\n\nUser-facing Features\n\n\n  Robust filtering support inspired by GitHub’s notification filtering style.\n    \n      Search is also included.\n    \n  \n  Proper hierarchial presentation of error details, including probable cause and suggested remeditation.\n  Support for notification status (notifications can be marked as read and unread)\n    \n      Future: Notifications can be acknowledged or resolved.\n    \n  \n  Event-based notification via Graphql subscription (provided by Meshery Server and any upstream components or externally managed systems, like Kubernetes)\n  Infinite scroll for pagination.\n\n\nState Management and Internal Details\n\n\n  The State on client is managed using Redux Tooltik and Rtk-query\n  Update and Delete operations are optimistically handled.\n  Network Request are cached and are invalidated when new events come or events are deleted/updated.\n  Due to need for infinite scroll and optimistic update the events are stored globally in Redux.\n\n\nNotification Severities and Colors\n\nNotification severities and colors are defined in the constants file, ui/components/NotificationCenter/constants.js.\n\nNotification Filtering and Searching\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n  Usage\n  Props\n  Examples\n\n\nThe Notfication Center includes a resusable component, TypingFilter, for sophisticated filtering and searching of notifications based on their attributes. It adheres to the GitHub-style syntax for filtering, offering a straight-forward and adaptable way to filter and search notification details. The TypingFilter component is a customizable React component that enables real-time filtering and selection based on user input.\n\nThe state for filtering is managed by a state machine created using a reducer. TypingFilter supports multiple filters, suggestions and completions.\n\nUsage\n\nThe TypingFilter component is designed to provide an interactive filtering experience in your application. Here’s how you can use it:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TypingFilter from './path-to-TypingFilter';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  // Define a filter schema that describes the available filter options.\n  const filterSchema = {\n    // Define your filter categories here\n    // Example:\n    SEVERITY: {\n      value: \"severity\",\n      description: \"Filter by severity\",\n      values: [\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"],\n      multiple : true // default\n    },\n    // Add more filter categories as needed\n  };\n\n  // Define a callback function to handle filter changes.\n  const handleFilterChange = (filteredData) =&gt; {\n    // Implement your logic to react to the filtered data.\n    // This function will be called when the user applies a filter. ( on presing enter in input)\n    console.log(\"Filtered data:\", filteredData);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;TypingFilter\n        filterSchema={filterSchema}\n        handleFilter={handleFilterChange}\n      /&gt;\n      {/* Your other components */}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n\n\nProps\n\nThe TypingFilter component accepts the following props:\n\n\n  filterSchema (object, required): An object that defines available filter options. Each property of this object represents a filter category with the following properties:\n    \n      value (string, required): The filter name used for filtering within the category.\n      description (string, required): Description of the filter category.\n      type (string, optional): The data type of the filter (e.g., “string”, “number”).\n      values (array, optional): Possible values for the filter.\n    \n  \n  handleFilter (function, required): A callback function that is called when the user applies a filter. This function receives the filtered data as an argument.\n\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) for TypingFilter Component\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation used to manage the state of the TypingFilter component. The FSM is responsible for handling user interactions, such as selecting filters, entering values, and clearing the filter, within the component. The FSM implementation within the TypingFilter component ensures that user interactions are correctly processed and managed, resulting in a smooth and intuitive filtering experience.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n  Overview\n  State Definitions\n  Reducers\n  State Transitions\n  Initial State Handling\n\n\nState Definitions\n\nThe FSM code defines three sets of constants to represent important elements within the state management:\n\n1. FILTERING_STATE\n\nDefines the possible states that the TypingFilter component can be in. These states include:\n\n  IDLE: Represents the initial state when the component is not actively filtering.\n  SELECTING_FILTER: Indicates that the user is selecting a filter.\n  SELECTING_VALUE: Indicates that the user is entering a filter value.\n\n\n2. FILTER_EVENTS\n\nRepresents the events that trigger state transitions within the FSM. Some of the events include:\n\n  START: Initiates the filtering process.\n  SELECT: Indicates the selection of a filter.\n  INPUT_CHANGE: Represents a change in the filter input.\n  CLEAR: Clears the filter.\n  EXIT: Exits the filtering process.\n\n\n3. Delimiter\n\nDefines delimiters used to separate filter and value entries within the component. Delimiters include:\n\n  FILTER: Separates multiple filters.\n  FILTER_VALUE: Separates filters from their corresponding values.\n\n\nReducers\n\nThe FSM implementation includes two key reducer functions:\n\n1. commonReducer\n\nThis common reducer function handles events that are common across all states. It includes logic to handle “CLEAR” and “EXIT” events, which reset the component’s state and clear any entered values.\n\n2. filterSelectionReducer\n\nThe filterSelectionReducer is a specific reducer used to manage transitions between “SELECTING_FILTER” and “SELECTING_VALUE” states. It handles events related to selecting filters and entering values. The logic ensures that delimiters are appropriately added or removed when the user interacts with the filter.\n\nState Transitions\n\nState transitions are managed based on user actions and the current state of the component. For example, when the user selects a filter, the state transitions from “SELECTING_FILTER” to “SELECTING_VALUE.” When the user inputs values or clears the filter, the state transitions are managed accordingly.\n\nInitial State Handling\n\nThe FSM implementation includes handling for the initial state, where it listens for the “START” event to transition from “IDLE” to “SELECTING_FILTER.” This ensures that the filtering process is initiated when the user interacts with the component.\n\nBulk Operations\n\nBulk operations in the Notification Center allow users to perform actions like deleting multiple notifications or changing the status of multiple notifications in a batch. This documentation outlines the key features and functionality of bulk operations, including the restriction of performing only one bulk operation at a time, the disabling of buttons during ongoing operations, and the display of a loading icon to indicate ongoing activity.\n\nHow It Works\n\nInitiating a Bulk Operation\n\n\n  Users select the notifications they want to include in the bulk operation. This is typically done by checking checkboxes next to each notification.\n  After selecting notifications, users trigger the desired bulk operation (e.g., delete or change status) by clicking the corresponding action button.\n  Once initiated, the bulk operation begins processing the selected notifications.\n\n\nFurther Enchacements\n\nTo ensure a seamless user experience with bulk operations in the Notification Center, consider the following best practices:\n\n\n  Provide clear and concise messaging to inform users about the progress and outcome of the bulk operation.\n  Implement error handling to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the operation and communicate errors to the user.\n  Consider offering a confirmation dialog before initiating a bulk operation to prevent accidental actions.\n\n\nMetadata Formatter\n\nWhen an event is received from the server, it adheres to a fixed schema containing information that is valuable for presentation to the user. This information typically includes details such as the description, date, user_id, system_id, action, and acted-upon resources. Additionally, sometimes there may be a detailed traceback, a summary, or a comprehensive error log, all of which are dynamically generated data encapsulated within the metadata of the event. Presenting this structured data in a user-friendly manner is a crucial task because it contains valuable insights into ongoing operations.\n\nTo accomplish this task, we employ metadata formatters that transform structured data into visually appealing formats. There are currently two types of formatters in use:\n\n\n  Metadata Specific Formatters: These formatters are specifically designed for particular types of metadata, such as Error and DryRunResponse. Metadata Specific Formatters are implemented as React components that take the metadata as input and render it within the component.\n  Dynamic Formatter: Since metadata can vary significantly in structure, it is not practical to create a specific formatter for each kind. Dynamic formatters analyze the schema’s structure and apply custom-defined rules for formatting:\n    \n      Text strings are rendered using the BodySectionRenderer (more on this later).\n      Arrays are rendered using the ArrayRenderer.\n      Key-value pairs are rendered using the KeyValueRenderer.\n      Nested objects are recursively rendered.\n    \n  \n\n\nBodySectionRenderer\nThe BodySectionRenderer is responsible for formatting and rendering raw text strings into React components. During this process, it parses the string to replace external links with &lt;Link&gt; components and checks if the link matches predefined sites to render the link accordingly.\n\nArrayRenderer\nThe ArrayRenderer is responsible for rendering an array of items in a recursive manner, presenting them as a bulletized list using the MetdataFormatter.\n\nKeyValueRenderer\nObject properties with string values are considered key-value pairs and are rendered as such.\n\nThe Metadata Specific Formatter\nCertain metadata, such as Kubernetes responses and Errors, hold high importance and have dedicated renderers. These dedicated renderers can still utilize the dynamic formatter to format specific parts of the response, such as DryRunResponse.\n\nReusability\nWhile this system was initially developed for our events and notification center, the components it comprises are highly reusable and can be employed in other contexts where dynamic formatting of structured data is required."

It’s aimed at developers who want to design applications aligned with the same brand and ensure a uniform user experience across different products.\n\nSistent leverages Material UI libraries and provides a custom theme on top of it for a consistent look and feel. It includes components, icons, and design tokens that developers can readily integrate into their applications. By using Sistent, developers can save time and effort while maintaining a high-quality user experience throughout Meshery.\n\nExample\n\n  This Modal is a Sistent Standard Modal used in validation of design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Sistent in Meshery UI\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n  Usage\n  How to use Sistent tokens/theme colors\n  Examples\n\n\nThe Sistent design system includes a variety of base components such as Button, Textfield, Checkbox, and more, which can be found here\n Additionally, it provides custom components like Modal, TransferList, and others, which are available here\n\nUsage\n\n\n  Import any base or custom component from @layer5/sistent.

Sistent specifies both light and dark themes.\n  \n  \n    Value:\nA value is a unique visual attribute assigned to a token via themes, such as hex codes or RGBA values, used to highlight specific colors. Avoid referencing exact values directly to ensure consistency; instead, use tokens to manage and implement reusable values.\n  \n  \n    Tokens:\nTokens serve as a shared language between design and development, detailing how to build user interfaces. Tokens represent context (background, text, component), role (success, warning, brand, inverse), and modifiers (secondary, tertiary, hover) derived from the color palette.\n  \n  \n    Role:\nRoles specify the context for applying colors. Different roles can share the same value but will have different use cases due to the token structure. These values can vary depending on the current theme.\n  \n\n\nHow to use these tokens/colors from sistent theme.\n\n\n  Import useTheme hook from @layer5/sistent to access the current theme\n  Use the UsesSistent wrapper to ensure the Sistent theme is applied to your components.\n  Utilize the useTheme hook to access theme properties and apply them to your components, such as setting the background style of the Button.\n\n\nimport { UsesSistent } from '&lt;path&gt;/SistentWrapper';\nimport {Button, useTheme} from `@layer5/sistent`\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n const theme = useTheme()\n    return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;UsesSistent&gt;\n    \n      &lt;Button\n        variant=\"contained\"\n        onClick={onClick}\n        style = {{\n            background: theme.palette.background.default,\n            text: theme.palette.text.secondary\n        }}\n      &gt;\n      {/* Text to display */}\n      &lt;/Button&gt;\n       \n    &lt;/UsesSistent&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n\n\n\nNOTE\nThe tokens and their roles are specific to their use. For example, use the background palette for background styles and the text palette for text styles."

Rebuilding the whole project can take time, and we don’t support hot reload because it’s more for development than for end-to-end testing.\n\n\nSeveral Test may break\nSome test cases required you to have kubernetes cluster and build meshery adapter as well, be aware of that. Which is out of scope for this documentationKubernetes Cluster: Installation of kubernetes cluster with Minikube.\nMeshery Adapters: Using Multiple Adapters\n\n\nNative OS Build (Recommended)\n\nThis approach is very quick to build, but also dependent on your operating system, so you need to have all dependencies necessary to be able compile and running the server.\n\n\n  Install &amp; Build the NextJS application for both the UI and UI Provider\n\n\nmake ui-build\n\n\n\n  Compile the Golang into binary file for Meshery Server\n\n\nmake build-server\n\n\n\n  Run the Meshery Server on localhost port 9081\n\n\nmake server-binary\n\n\nMeshery CLI\n\nThere is also Meshery CLI which can help you run the UI and Server, for more detail, you go to Meshery CLI documentation\n\nDocker Based Build\n\nAlternatively, a Docker-based setup can be utilized, simplifying the process, and ensuring consistency across different environments. It is closer to the production environment than the native solution but slower in terms of build time.\n\n\n  Build the docker container locally:\n\n\nmake docker-testing-env-build\n\n\n\n  Run the docker container on port 9081\n\n\nmake docker-testing-env\n\n\nSetup playwright\n\nFor playwrights, always try to use a native OS whenever possible. The Docker-based approach is intended only for unsupported OSes and is generally not recommended because it runs on top of Ubuntu images, which can be redundant if you already using Ubuntu or Windows.\n\nPlaywright on Native OS (Recommended)\n\nSetup playwright:\n\nmake test-setup-ui\n\n\nRun the all project and test cases:\n\nmake test-ui\n\n\nPlaywright server on docker based image\n\nThe first step is to pull the docker image from Azure Container Registry where the playwright stores their image using this command:\n\ndocker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:&lt;version&gt;-&lt;base-image&gt;\n\n\n\nPlaywright Versioning\nMake sure the version you are using matches the version of `@playwright/test` in the `package.json` dev dependencies\n\n\nHere is the example of pulling playwright v1.44.0 with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\ndocker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy\n\n\nStarting up playwright docker server:\n\ndocker run --rm --network host --init -it mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy /bin/sh -c \"cd /home/pwuser &amp;&amp; npx -y playwright@1.44.0 run-server --port 8080\"\n\n\n\nUnsafe Environment\nKeep in mind this is just for development purposes inside your local system and don’t try to expose your container network to the host system using --network host on production or CI\n\n\nIn the last step go to ui folder,\ncd ui;\n\n\nRun the test cases with Playwright CLI\n\nThere are several options we can use to run the test cases, in CLI:\n\nTo run playwright UI mode using the browser, you can add --ui in the cli, for example:\nnpx playwright test --ui\n\n\nIf you are using playwright from docker, you can use --ui-port=&lt;playwright-docker-server&gt;, for example:\nnpx playwright test --ui-port=8080\n\n\nTo run playwright for specific project only, for example meshery-provider, you can run this command:\nnpx playwright test --ui --project=chromium-meshery-provider \n\n\nTo run specific test, you can add the test file location, for example:\nnpx playwright test --ui --project=chromium-meshery-provider tests/e2e/service-mesh-performance.spec.js \n\n\nFor more detail, you can read the Playwright Cli docs\n\nTesting Meshery &amp; Local Provider\n\nBy default our test cases is running against both Meshery and Local Provider, we are utilizing playwright feature such as:\n\n\n  StorageState: In meshery setup auth, we have 2 storage state, which store a session for Meshery and Local provider.\n  Project: After the setup completes, it will run the project-based test depending on which storage state for the Local Provider and one for the Meshery Provider\n  Test Parameterize:  In the Local provider we are limiting some features to test against. For the missing features, we leverage this playwright feature to check or even skip the test. If it is not possible to run then you need to specify the provider directly from the test, and make sure the test is wrapped using:\n\n\nimport { expect, test } from './fixtures/project';\n\ntest('Random test', async ({ provider }) =&gt; {\n  if (provider === \"Meshery\") {\n    // Run this for testing Meshery provider\n  }\n\n  if (provider === \"None\") {\n    // Run this for testing Local provider\n  }\n});\n\n\nTesting Policy\n\nTo maintain consistency across test cases, every new test will be tagged with @unstable. This will ensure that it appears with a warning icon rather than a failing icon in the test reporter comments on pull requests. For example:\n\nimport { expect, test } from './fixtures/project';\n\ntest('Random test',  { tag: '@unstable' }, async ({ provider }) =&gt; {\n  // Test cases here\n  // ...\n});\n\n\nDebugging Test on Github Actions\n\nWe also storing test result on every PR in github actions, in case you need to debug it further:\n\n\n  Check the PR you are made, go to the bottom of PR directly above the comment\n  Wait until all github actions completed, and scroll until you see Meshery UI and Server / UI end-to-end tests\n  Click details and it will redirect you to the actions workflow\n  Go to summary tab, scroll down until you see artifact, and check the artifact playwright-report\n  Download the artifact\n  Extract the file into a folder\n  Go to Playwright Trace Page\n  From the test folder pick one folder which represents the test, you want to check\n  Upload the trace file"

						"content": "UI Contribution Flow\n\nMeshery UI is built on React and Next.js. In nearly all cases, while contributing to Meshery UI, you will need to build and run Meshery Server as well. Meshery Server is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. To make building of each component easier a Makefile is included in the main repository folder. Use make to build any and all components.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe following is a list of top-level frameworks, libraries, design system used in Meshery UI.\n\n\n  NextJS - Server and router\n  ReactJS - User Interface library\n  Material UI - Design System\n  BillboardJS - Charting library, used for exposing Grafana and Prometheus-collected metrics\n  CytoscapeJS - a visualization tool for canvas-based, visual topology (networks)\n\n\nMeshery Server APIs\n\nThe API overview in the Extensibility guide offers high-level insight, while each API reference (below) offers details pertaining to each API endpoints’ behavior and use.\n\nREST API\n\nMeshery provides a REST API available through the default port of 9081/tcp at &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api/. See the REST API Reference for a complete list of endpoints available with short description of their purpose and example code.\n\nGraphQL API\n\nMeshery provides a GraphQl API available through the default port of 9081/tcp at &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api/graphql/query. See the GraphQL API Reference Relay is the client used.\n\nDesign\n\nMeshery UI is a significant component of the value proposition Meshery offers to individuals and organizations seeking to adopt and operate a cloud native infrastructure.\n\nUser Flows / Wireframing / Mockups\n\nFigma is used as the user flow and UI mockup design tool. The Meshery UI design file can be viewed by using this open invitation for view access. Fill-in a community member form to gain access to additional community resources.\n\nDesign Goals\n\nThe designs in this specification should result in enabling:\n\n\n  \n    User experience should be intuitive - Meshery’s UX, which includes Meshery UI as a component of the overall UX, needs to be simple, but powerful. This is achieved through intuitive layouts and predefined filters that accommodate common tasks. This is achieved through sensible defaults, consistency of user interaction paradigms and features that delight the user.\n  \n  \n    Extensible - Meshery UI should be a first-class component of Meshery, but also facilitate third-party integrations.\n  \n  \n    Real-time - Meshery UI should be event-driven where possible.\n  \n\n\nSetup\n\n\nWindows User?\nSee Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows.\n\n\nNode Version Recommendations\n\nWe recommend using Node 18 LTS. Meshery UI’s build script supports other Node versions as well, including node16 and node17, but is recommended to use Node 18 LTS.\n\nLinting-UI\n\nWhen contributing to Meshery UI, it is advisable to:\n\n\n  Use prettier and eslint plugin for Visual Studio Code.\n  Disable plugins other than prettier and eslint for formatting and linting, if any.\n\n\nInstall UI dependencies\n\nTo install/update the UI dependencies:\n\n\n\nmake ui-setup\n\n\n\nBuild and export UI\n\nTo build and export the UI code:\n\n\n\nmake ui-build\n\n\n\nUsing this command, changes that you make are not rebuilt automatically. You will have to run this command again to rebuild the UI and see them.\n\nNow that the UI code is built, Meshery UI will be available at http://localhost:9081 when Meshery Server is running (Read below).\n\nTo build and export the UI code and build and run Meshery Server:\n\n\n\nmake ui-server\n\n\n\nRun Meshery Server\n\nTo start running Meshery Server locally:\n\n\n\nmake server\n\n\nNow, Meshery will run on the default port http://localhost:9081.\n\nPlease note: If you see “Meshery Development Incompatible” while trying to sign into Meshery Server, then follow these steps:\n\n\n  \n\n\nPotential Solution:\n\n\n  \n    Go to your meshery folder in your local-system where you’ve cloned it.\nExecute:\n  \n  git remote add upstream https://github.com/meshery/meshery\n  git fetch upstream\n  Restart the meshery server\n  Additionally, before restarting the server, if you like to pull the latest changes, you can do: git pull upstream master\n\n\nUI Development Server\n\nIf you want to work on the UI, it will be a good idea to use the included UI development server. You can run the UI development server by running the following command:\n\n\n\nmake ui\n\n\n\nRefer to Contributing to Meshery Server, if needed.\n\n\n  Make sure to have Meshery Server configured, up and running on the default port http://localhost:9081 and choose a provider to login with (visit http://localhost:9081) before proceeding to access and work on the UI server at http://localhost:3000.\n\n\nAny UI changes made now will automatically be rebuilt and served in your browser.\n\nRunning end-to-end integration tests\n\nRefer to Meshery UI Testing for details of how to contribute and benefit from Meshery UI testing.\n\nStatic Files, Icons and Images\n\nThe Meshery UI public folder contains static files. Its folder structure looks like this:\n\nmeshery\n└── ui\n    └── public\n        └── static\n            ├── favicon.png\n            ├── fonts\n            ├── img\n            └── style\n\n\nImages and icons used in Meshery UI need to be sourced from the public directory of images. The files written inside this directory should only end with the extensions like .svg, .png, .jpg or .jpeg. Always use vector-based graphics (.svg), unless your have extenuating circumstances.\n\nConventions for SVG files\n\n\n  SVGs should be optimized and compressed.\n    \n      Use an online, SVG optimizer, like https://www.svgviewer.dev, to compress the file(s) to smaller size.\n    \n  \n  All SVGs should have height and width properties set to 20px x 20px by default. Ensure that height and width attributes are always set in original SVG.\n  All SVGs should have height and width included as a style prop in their React component.\n  Always include this XML header in each SVG image:\n\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE svg&gt;\n\n\n  Svg can only fall under two categories, and this categories should be the name of folder \n    \n      white: containing white or mono-colored version of that SVG\n      color: containing colored version of that SVG.\ne.g.: the Meshery logo icon folder structure looks like this:\n        └── img\n └── meshery\n     ├── white\n     |   └── meshery-white.svg\n     └── color\n         └── meshery-color.svg\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Avoid any kind of duplicity in the versions of icons used.\n\n\nFor accessing the svg file as data-url, the utf8 encoding should be used in place of base64.Use encodeURIComponent on SVG data URIs. \\\n\n\n\nlet svg = &#39;data:image/svg+xml;utf8,&#39; + encodeURIComponent(svgFile);"

						"content": "### Introduction\n\nMeshery is a powerful multi-cloud management platform that enables you to configure, deploy, and manage AWS resources, such as EC2 instances. In order to manage AWS resources, Meshery uses [AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/aws-controllers-for-kubernetes-ack/). ACK facilitates the bridge between Kubernetes and AWS services, enabling Meshery to manage AWS resources and Meshery enabling you to benefit from the enhanced experience that Meshery and its extensions offer. \n\nMeshery has a number of extensions, adapters, and plugins. In this tutorial, we will use the [Kanvas]({{site.baseurl}}/extensions/kanvas) extension to provide an intuitive, visual experience for configuring and deploying an AWS EC2 instance. Among other aspects, Kanvas provides an alternative to command-line tools like `kubectl` by offering infrastructure as design. Once you connect your Kubernetes cluster to Meshery, you can configure, deploy, and manage AWS resources directly from the Kanvas interface, making deployments more intuitive and collaborative \n\nIn this guide, you’ll explore how to deploy AWS resources, including setup and architecture details. This guide also covers how to access pre-configured designs from [Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) and demonstrates how to visualize deployed resources using Kanvas' operator mode, offering a comprehensive understanding of AWS resource management.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. [Self Hosted Meshery Installation](https://docs.meshery.io/installation).\n1. **AWS Account**: An active AWS account is required for accessing AWS resources.\n1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: A running Kubernetes cluster, such as Minikube or EKS.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n- [Overview of Deployment Steps](#overview-of-deployment-steps)\n- [Connect your Kubernetes Cluster to Meshery](#1-connect-your-kubernetes-cluster-to-meshery)\n- [Configure and Deploy the EC2 Controller](#2-configure-and-deploy-the-ec2-controller)\n  - [Configure the AWS Secret](#configure-the-aws-secret)\n  - [Configure the EC2 Controller Pod to Use the Secret](#configure-the-ec2-controller-pod-to-use-the-secret)\n  - [Deploy EC2 Controller Design](#deploy-ec2-controller-design)\n- [Deploy the VPC Workflow](#3-deploy-the-vpc-workflow)\n- [Deploy EC2 Instance](#4-deploy-ec2-instance)\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n### Overview of Deployment Steps\n\n**1. Integrate Your Kubernetes Cluster with Meshery**\n\nBegin by connecting your Kubernetes cluster to Meshery, establishing the foundation for interaction with AWS resources via ACK.\n\n**2. Set Up Essential AWS Resources**\n\nUse Meshery to deploy foundational resources such as VPCs, subnets, and other networking components necessary for your EC2 instance within AWS.\n\n**3. Verify and Monitor Deployment**\n\nOnce deployment is complete, verify the EC2 instances via the AWS Management Console or Meshery’s visualization mode, where you’ll gain an interactive view of your deployed resources.\n\n### 1. Connect your Kubernetes Cluster to Meshery\n\nTo begin, connect your Kubernetes cluster to Meshery. This guide uses `minikube`, which supports two deployment options for Meshery:\n\n- **In-Cluster Deployment**: Deploys Meshery within the Kubernetes cluster using Helm inside the meshery namespace.\n\n- **Out-of-Cluster Deployment**: Runs Meshery in Docker containers, allowing external connectivity to the Minikube cluster.\n\nFor this guide, the `in-cluster deployment` method is used.  Follow this [setup guide for Meshery on Minikube](https://docs.meshery.io/installation/kubernetes/minikube) to deploy Meshery in-cluster. After the deployment, open the Meshery UI at `localhost:9081` to verify that the cluster is listed. Click on the cluster name to ping and confirm connectivity.\n\n![Connect Minikube Cluster](/pages/guides/tutorials/aws-controllers/aws-connection.png)\n\n### 2. Configure and Deploy the EC2 Controller\n\nIn this section, you will set up the EC2 controller and configure it to connect to your AWS account. This process involves creating a Kubernetes secret that contains your AWS access keys and configuring the controller pod to consume this secret. While these configurations are already included in our designs, the steps will be demonstrated for clarity.\n\n1. **Clone the EC2 Controller Design**: Start by [cloning the EC2 controller design](https://cloud.layer5.io/catalog/content/catalog/ec2-controller-design-28a7fad9-c7ef-440a-a8f0-7614e072b866?source=%257B%257D) from the catalog. To do this, click on **Clone** on the catalog page. Once cloned, open the design in the playground, and you will see it displayed on the Kanvas.\n\n    ![EC2 Controller Chart](/pages/guides/tutorials/aws-controllers/controller-chart.png)\n\n1. **Set the Deployment Namespace**: This design has been configured to be deployed in the `ack-system` namespace.\n\nThis EC2 controller design includes:\n\n -  **The EC2 Controller Pod**: This runs the main EC2 controller. This pod is responsible for managing the lifecycle of EC2 instances and their associated resources.\n -  **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: These CRDs define the desired state of various AWS resources, such as VPCs, subnets, NAT gateways, and other networking components.By utilizing these CRDs, the EC2 controller can interact with the AWS API to create, update, and manage these resources.\n -  **Service Account**: The service account associated with the controller pod has the necessary IAM permissions. These permissions allow the controller to perform essential functions, such as creating and managing AWS resources.\n - **AWS Credentials secret**: The AWS credentials secret stores your AWS access keys and secret access keys securely. This secret is essential for authenticating the AWS controller with your AWS account.\n\n#### Configure the AWS Secret\n\nTo connect the EC2 controller to AWS, create a Kubernetes secret containing your AWS credentials.\n\n1. Double-click the Secret component to open its configuration.\n\n1. Under **Data**, add the base 64 encoded values of your AWS keys.\n    - **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: ``\n    - **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: ``\n\n    Encode your AWS key and secret with a [base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/), then enter them in the configuration.\n\n    ![Configure Secret](/pages/guides/tutorials/aws-controllers/configure-secret.png)\n\n#### Configure the EC2 Controller Pod to Use the Secret\n\nWhile this step is already handled in the design, but it's worth clarifying how the controller pod connects to the secret through environment variables.\n\n1. Double-click the EC2 controller pod to open its configuration tab.\n\n1. In the **Containers** section, scroll to **env** and click the **+** to add two environment variables:\n\n    - **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: For the name, put in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, click on the `secret Key Ref` dropdown and put in the **key** as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and the secret resource **name** as `aws_creds`.\n    - **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Set the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` similarly, using the same secret key reference.\n\n#### Deploy EC2 Controller Design\n\nAfter configuring your design, the next step is deployment. To learn more about deploying your designs in Meshery, see [Deploying Meshery Designs](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery?chapter=deploying-meshery-designs). To deploy the resources, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **Actions** button at the top of the Kanvas and click **Deploy**.\n\n1. Once the deployment is complete, click **Open in Visualizer** to switch to Operator mode and see a pre-filtered view of your just deployed resources in the cluster. Alternatively, you can click *Operate* at the top of the Kanvas to enter Operater mode.\n\n    ![Operator Mode](/pages/guides/tutorials/aws-controllers/controller-operator-mode.png)\n\nTo get the filtered view shown above, click the filter icon and adjust the following settings:\n\n  - For `view Selector` select `single namespace`\n  - For `Kinds` select `Deployment, Pod, secret`\n  - For `namspace` select `ack-system`\n\n### 3. Deploy the VPC Workflow\n\nThis step involves deploying all the necessary resources to create the VPC and other networking components for the EC2 instance. The resources included in this network toplology include:\n\n- 1 VPC\n- 1 Internet Gateway\n- 1 NAT Gateway\n- 1 Elastic IP\n- 2 Route Tables (Public and Private)\n- 2 Subnets (1 Public, 1 Private)\n- 1 Security Group\n\n1. Start by [cloning the design](https://cloud.layer5.io/catalog/content/catalog/vpc-workflow-design-50cac19e-209c-4acf-b91c-4784281db033?source=%257B%257D) from the catalog.\n\n1. Once cloned, open the design in the playground, and you will see it displayed on the Kanvas.\n\n1. You can adjust CIDR blocks, region, and other parameters as needed through the configuration tab. This design is configured to be deployed in the `us-east-1` region.\n\n1. Click the **Actions** button to deploy.\n\n1. After deployment, verify the setup in your AWS Management Console.\n\n### 4. Deploy EC2 Instance\n\nWith the VPC and networking resources set up, deploy the EC2 instances within the VPC using the following steps.\n\n1. [Clone the EC2 instances design](https://cloud.layer5.io/catalog/content/catalog/ec2-instances-design-a344f109-2d92-41da-8644-3bc285c3ca9e?source=%257B%257D) from the catalog.\n\n1. Open the design on the Playground and deploy the instances.\n\n1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console to confirm the instances' successful deployment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis guide covered the steps to deploy and manage EC2 instances using Meshery. It demonstrated how to leverage pre-configured catalog designs, configure and deploy resources, set up the controller and necessary secrets, configure VPC networking resources, and ultimately deploy the EC2 instances. It also showed how to visualize Kubernetes resources using Kanvas's operator mode. This process highlights the ease of managing AWS resources visually through Meshery’s Kanvas interface, eliminating the need for CLI commands."

						"id": "guides-infrastructure-management-sample-apps",
						"title": "Deploying Sample Applications",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /guides/infrastructure-management/sample-apps",
						"content": "Meshery includes a few sample applications to help you explore cloud native infrastructure. Each is a collection of microservices for experimental purposes of learning about running workloads in Kubernetes clusters both on and off of a service mesh. When deploying a sample app onto your service mesh, your sample application needs will need to be externaally exposed from the cluster, if you would like to access it externally. There are a myriad of ways to do this, specific to the service mesh you are using.\n\nA popular way of exposing your cluster is by using [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), an API object that defines rules which allow external access to services in a cluster. \n\n- [Set up Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#the-ingress-resource)\n- [Set up Ingress on Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/)\n\n## Deploy a sample app on Meshery\n\n1. Go to the management page of any service mesh and install any of its stable versions.\n\n\n1. Click (+) on **Manage Sample Application Lifecycle**. You will now be able to see a dropdown menu with the available sample applications.\n\n\n1. Click on the sample application you want to deploy. This might take up to a minute. You will be notified when the sample application has been deployed.\n\n\n### [BookInfo](https://github.com/layer5io/istio-service-mesh-workshop/blob/master/lab-2/README.md#what-is-the-bookinfo-application)\n\nOriginally built by Istio, BookInfo is a sample application which on deployment displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews. The application comprises of four microservices:\n\n   - **productpage**: The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.\n   - **details**: The details microservice contains book information.\n   - **reviews**: The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.\n   - **ratings**: The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.\n\nOnce BookInfo is deployed, you can use Meshery to apply custom configurations to control traffic, inject latency, perform context-based routing, and so on. \n\n\n\n### [Emojivoto](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/emojivoto)\n\nEmojivoto is a microservice application, originally built by Linkerd that allows users to vote for their favorite emoji, and tracks votes received on a leaderboard. The application is composed of three microservices:\n\n   - **emojivoto-web**: Web frontend and REST API\n   - **emojivoto-emoji-svc**: gRPC API for finding and listing emoji\n   - **emojivoto-voting-svc**: gRPC API for voting and leaderboard\n\n\n\n### [ImageHub](https://layer5.io/projects/image-hub)\n\nImage Hub is a sample application for exploring WebAssembly modules used as Envoy filters. The application was originally written to run on Consul. However, it doesn't have any dependency on Consul and can be deployed on any service mesh. These modules can be used to implement multi-tenancy or to implement per user rate limiting in your application’s endpoints, without messing with your application infrastructure. \nFollow this tutorial to set up [ImageHub with Ingress](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub#use-image-hub)\n\n\n\n### [HTTPBin](https://httpbin.org)\n\nHttpBin is a simple HTTP request and response service that responds to many kinds of http/https requests including the standard http request methods (or verbs) used by REST.\n\n\n\n### [Linkerd Books](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/booksapp)\n\nLinkerd Books is a sample Ruby based application. It is designed to demonstrate the various value propositions, including debugging, observability, and monitoring of your service mesh. It can be used to scope out your mesh's efficiency and for debugging.\n\n\n\n### [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)\n\nOnline Boutique is a sample cloud-native application, originally built by Google. It comprises of 10 microservices and can be used to showcase and work with Kubernetes, Istio, gRPC and OpenCensus. On deployment, it runs a web-based e-commerce demo application, an example of which can be seen below:"

					"concepts-logical-designs": {
						"id": "concepts-logical-designs",
						"title": "Designs",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /concepts/logical/designs",
						"content": "Like a Google Doc, Designs are your primary tool for collaborative authorship of your infrastructure and services. A Design describes all the resources and their properties that you want for a single deployment based on Meshery’s declarative syntax (see [Meshery Schemas repo](https://github.com/meshery/schemas)). By default, Designs are stored in your user account, but can be manually exported, programmatically snapshotted, or automatically synchronized to any OCI-compatible registry (e.g. Docker Hub, AWS ECR, and so on), or Git-based repositories (coming in v0.8). You can share designs and collaborate in real-time on their creation. Designs can be imported, exported, versioned, forked, merged, snapshotted, published, shared, embedded, templatized, and more.\n\nAs the deployable unit in Meshery, a Design consists of [Components]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/components) and [Relationships]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/relationships). Designs are how you can describe your desired infrastructure state.\n\n### Constraints on Designs\n\n- Designs belong to only one Workspace at any given time. Designs can be transferred between Workspaces.\n- Designs can be shared with other users or teams.\n- The user who creates a Design is the Design **Owner**. The Design Owner can grant other users *read* or *write* access to the Design and can *delete* the Design.\n  \n### Features of Designs\n\n- Designs can be **cloned**. Cloning a Design creates a new Design that is a copy of the original Design. The new Design is owned by the user who cloned it.\n- Designs can be **merged**. Merging a Design combines two Designs into a single Design. \n  \n- Designs can be exported as JSON files or OCI images.\n- [Designs can be listed in Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=24&sort=relevance&page=1) repos.\n- Designs can be imported:\n  - as Kubernetes Manifests, Docker Compose, Helm Charts, or Meshery Designs.\n  - from individual YAML files, remote HTTP location, local filesystem, or OCI images.\n- Designs can be exported or embedded.\n  - Designs can be embedded in web pages either as a bundle of HTML or as a React component using the [meshery-design-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@layer5/meshery-design-embed) NPM package.\n- Designs can be [snapshotted](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/snapshot). Snapshots are immutable. Snapshots can be compared for differences between Design versions.\n- Designs can be published or unpublished. Published Designs are available to all users of any Meshery instance through the [Catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/catalog). Unpublished Designs can still be available to other users if that Design is made public.\n- Designs are versioned. Each time a Design is saved, a new version is created.\n  \n- Designs can be deployed. Deploying a Design involves incorporating one or more components into your Design, configuring their relationships, and deploying them to one or more Environments. By default, any user of a Workspace can deploy a Design.\n- Designs can be deleted.\n  - Designs can be archived and restored (depending upon Remote Provider)\n- Designs can be compared.\n- Designs can be validated. Validation involves checking the syntax of the Design and ensuring that all the components and patterns referenced in the Design are available.\n- Designs can be dry-run deployed. Use dry-runs (or practice run) to ensure that your design works correctly and will not result in undesired changes.\n- Designs can be audited. Auditing a Design involves checking the Design for security vulnerabilities, compliance with best practices, and adherence to the organization's policies.\n- Designs can be searched.\n- Designs can be filtered and viewed as a live-running deployment in your Environments.\n- Designs can be sorted by name, date created, date modified, or by the visibility level (public or private) or Catalog published status.\n- Designs can be grouped into Workspaces and shared among teams and deployed to Environment(s).\n- Designs can be tagged by Technology and/or by Type (e.g. Deployment, Security, Resiliency, Observability, etc.)\n\n- _(Coming in v0.9)_ Designs can be converted into reusable Patterns. Creating a Pattern involves replacing the values of the variables in the design with the values provided by another user. Patterns can be shared with other users or teams.\n\n### Controlling Access to Designs\n\nWhen creating a new design by default it's visibility level will be set to **public**. Remove providers have the option of offering additional visibility levels like **private** and **published**.\n\n## Meshery Designs and Models Explained\n\nDesigns are the deployable unit in Meshery. [Models]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/models) are the unit of packaging for Components. Components are described in Designs. Models are not directly deployed. Designs and their Components are.\n\n### Meshery Models\n\nMeshery Models represent the fundamental building blocks of your infrastructure. Think of them as blueprints or templates that define the structure, components, and configurations of your deployments. These models encapsulate everything from network configurations to service definitions, making them essential for consistent and scalable deployments across environments.\n\n### Meshery Designs\n\nOn the other hand, Meshery Designs are the practical implementations based on Meshery Models. They represent declarations of your infrastructure deployments, customized according to specific use cases, environments, and requirements. Meshery Designs allow you to create, manage, and deploy complex architectures seamlessly, leveraging the power and flexibility of Meshery Models as their foundation.\n\nDesigns are the blueprints for your deployments, while Meshery Models are the internal components that provide the building blocks and knowledge to fulfill those blueprints.\n\n### Using Designs\n\nSee the following tutorials on how to use Meshery Designs for collaboratively managing infrastructure.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      🧑‍🔬 Tutorials\n    \n  \n  \n      {% assign tutorials = site.pages | where: \"category\",\"tutorials\" %}\n      {% for item in tutorials %}\n      {% if item.type==\"guides\" and item.category==\"tutorials\" and item.language==\"en\" -%}\n        {{ item.title }}\n        {% if item.abstract != \" \" %}\n          -  {{ item.abstract }}\n        {% endif %}\n        \n        {% endif %}\n      {% endfor %}\n  \n\n\nTry the [Meshery Playground](/installation/playground) for a hands-on experience with Meshery Designs."

						"content": "## Edges Style Guide\n\nIn Meshery, an edge is a visual representation of a relationship or connection between two or more components within your infrastructure. Occasionally, edges might be self-referential, for example, a network connection over a loopback interface in a Kubernetes Pod. Relationships can be of various types, defining how the components interact, depend on, or influence each other.\n\nMeshery supports multiple types of relationships, such as network connections, bindings, permissions, and hierarchical associations. See [Relationships]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/relationships) for a set of examples.\n\nFrom a design perspective, edge styles provide a clear and intuitive way to understand the complex interdependencies in your cloud-native environment. From an operational perspective, edge styles can change dynamically along with your infrastructure, reflecting the real-time state of your components and their relationships. By visualizing edges, Meshery helps you identify potential bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the performance of your applications.\n\nMeshery Designs carefully consider the visual style used for edges, imbuing meaning behind their weight, color, stroke, and arrowhead styles. The following list represents all edge styles and their current meaning in a general context.\n\n\n\n{% include extension-guide.html\n data_file=\"edges\"\n guide_title=\"Edge\"\n guide_description=\"Description\"\n guide_svg=\"SVG\"\n guide_assests_folder=\"shapes\"\n%}"

						"url": " /concepts/logical/environments",
						"content": "Meshery Environments allow you to logically group related [Connections](#connections) and their associated [Credentials](#credentials). Environments make it easier for you to manage, share, and work with a collection of resources as a group, instead of dealing with all your Connections and Credentials on an individual basis.\n\n### Assigning Resources to an Environment\n\nAssign any number of Connections to an environment whether that Connection is managed or unmanaged (see [MeshSync](/concepts/architecture/meshsync) to learn more about managed and unmanaged Connections). In-turn, assign any number of Environments to one or more [Workspaces](/concepts/logical/workspaces). Connections (and any associated Credentials) that are assigned to an Environment become immediately available for use in any associated Workspace.\n\n### Sharing Resources between Environments\n\nEnvironments can share resources. For example, you might create an environment named \"production\" and assign three connections: a GitHub connection, a Kubernetes connection, and a Prometheus connection. Subsequently, you also define a an environment named \"dev/test \"and assign three connections: a different Kubernetes connection, a different Prometheus connection, _and_ the same GitHub connection that is also assigned to the \"production\" environment.\n\n### Deleting an Environment\n\nDeleting an environment does not delete any resources (e.g. connections) currently contained with the environment. Resources that belong to others environments will continue to belong to those other environments. Learn more about the behavior of [lifecycle of connections]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/connections).\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Logical Grouping** Environments allow you to logically group related connections and their associated credentials. This makes it easier to manage, share, and work with a subset of resources instead of dealing with all your connections individually.\n\n- **Resource Sharing** Environments can be seamlessly assigned to [Workspaces](/concepts/logical/workspaces), another essential concept in Meshery. When you assign an Environment to a Workspace, you enable resource sharing among team members. This collaborative approach simplifies the sharing of connections and resources, making it easier to work together in cloud-native environments.\n\n## Connections and Credentials as Resources\n\n### Connections \n\nConnections are an integral part of Environment. These are cloud-native resources that can be both managed and unmanaged, and they're registered by the Meshery Server. Examples of connections include Kubernetes clusters, Prometheus instances, Jaeger tracers, and Nginx web servers.\n\nSee \"[Connections](/concepts/logical/connections)\" section for more information.\n\n### Credentials \n\nCredentials in an Environment are the keys to securely authenticate and access managed connections. For example, valid Prometheus secrets or Kubernetes API tokens are essential credentials for securely interacting with these managed resources.\n\nSee \"[Credentials](/concepts/logical/credentials)\" section for more information.\n\n## Summary\n\nEnvironments represent a collection of resources in the form of Connections - both of managed and unmanaged Connections. Environment resources are comprised of Connections (and implicitly any Credentials used by those assigned Connections). Create and use environments to organize your connections and credentials into groups, and then make these resources available to you and your teams by assigning environments to [Workspaces](/concepts/logical/workspaces)."

The platform supports a variety of application definition formats, and you can export designs using either the Meshery CLI or the Meshery UI.\n\n## Export Models Using Meshery CLI\n\n**Step 1: Install Meshery CLI**\n\nBefore you can use the Meshery CLI to export a [Model]((/concepts/logical/models)), you must first install it. You can install Meshery CLI by [following the instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/installation#install-mesheryctl).\n\n\n**Step 2: Export the Model**\n\nModel can be exported in 2 format and OCI or Compress file. These files contain different [components](/concepts/logical/components), [relationships](/concepts/logical/relationships) files and a model file. The files can be exported in either yaml or json by default it is exported as yaml.\n\n\nmesheryctl model export [model-name] \n\n\nDifferent file type and output type can be set using flags `-o` for oci and tar and `-t` for json or yaml. A location can also be specified using the -l flag where user needs to export the model\n\n\n**Example :**\n\n\nmesheryctl model export istio-base -o oci\n\n\n\nmesheryctl model export istio-base -o oci -t json\n\n\n\n**Note:** A `--discard-components --discard-relationships` flag is present to skip [component](/concepts/logical/components) and [relationships](/concepts/logical/relationships) generation in the export only the model is exported without any components and relationships.\n\n\n\n## Export Models Using Meshery UI\n\n**Step 1: Access the Meshery UI**\n\nTo Export a model into Meshery using the Meshery UI, you must first [install Meshery](/installation/quick-start)\n\n**Step 2: Navigate to Registry under Settings Page**\n\nOnce you have accessed the Meshery UI, navigate to the Registry under Settings. This page can be accessed by clicking on the Settings on the top right on setting icon and then selecting \"Registry\" and then choose model.\n\n\n\n**Step 3: Upload the Models**\n\nOn the Registry page, you can export your model by select Model in registry page. If no specific version the latest version is downloaded and if the specific version of model is selected then on clicking the `Export` button the model is exported as an OCI.\n\nThis Meshery model will include components, relationships.\n\n\n\nOnce the Meshery model has been exported, you can export your model anytime back using `Import` on UI and then visualize on Kanvas, operate and observe your components that are geneated from the crd. You can also use Meshery to deploy your Meshery Model in form of a design to any of your connected kubernetes clusters. For more information, see [connections](/installation/kubernetes)"

						"content": "Meshery features an extensible authorization system that offers the ability to deliver fine-grained access control across it's web-based user interface, [Meshery UI]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/architecture).\n\n## Authorization Keys\n\nThe extensible authorization system consists of a large set of keys. Each key uniquely represents a specific capability, for example, the ability to view a [Connection](/concepts/logical/connections), edit or delete a Connection. With the help of these keys, the system evaluates the permissions during runtime and renders UI both helping offer a secure management system and a customizable user experience.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Note\" content=\"The extensible authorization system is available to both Local and Remote Providers. Depending upon your chosen Remote Provider, keys, clustering of them, assigning them to user groups, not just individual users or to user roles may be offered.\" %}\n\n## Authorization Framework\n\nMeshery utilizes CASL (JS-based permission framework) to evaluate any given user's set of session keys against the built-in keyhooks populated through each invidual Meshery UI page. This allows for granular control over the UI, empowering you to tailor your Meshery experience to your organization's needs by limiting access to specific features and functionalities based on the user's assigned keys.\n\n\n  \n\n\n### Introduction to CASL.js\n\n[CASL.js](https://casl.js.org) is an isomorphic authorization JavaScript library which restricts what resources a given client is allowed to access. It's designed to be incrementally adoptable and can easily scale between a simple claim based and fully featured subject and attribute based authorization. It makes it easy to manage and share permissions/keys across UI components, API services, and database queries.\n\nAn example of how CASL evaluate permission in UI.\n{% capture code_content %}\n\t{!CAN(keys.DELETE_CONNECTION.action, keys.DELETE_CONNECTION.subject) && (\n\t\tDelete\n\t)}\n \n{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n Once a user has logged in, the backend will send a response with the permissions that the user has. Those permissions will be used to create abilities on the frontend, CASL gets updated with those abilities. The UI maintains a constant file containing all allowed permissions, referred to as keys. With the help of these keys, CAN function evaluates the permissions during runtime and renders UI.\n\n\nNote\n\nIt's important to understand not all pages uses CASL authorization, means even if you are not assigned with any role within organization you might access preferences page and Meshery UI dashboard.\n\n\n## Authorization using Local Provider\n\nMeshery's built-in identity provider, \"Local\" Provider, operates with a large set of predefined keys interspersed throughout Meshery UI and persisted in [Meshery Database](/concepts/architecture/database). These keys are used to evaluate the permissions of a given user and render the UI accordingly. The keys are grouped into three categories: `action`, `subject`, and `object`.\n\n{% include discuss.html %}"

provide and manage WASM filters?\n\nMeshery manages WASM filters for data plane proxies for:\n\n- Agility: in partnership with service mesh control planes, Meshery can dynamically load, configure, and unload filter(s) in running Envoy proxies.\n- Maintainability: To extend the functionality we don’t have to change the entire codebase.\n- Diversity : WASM filters can be easily compiled with many popular programming languages like C/C++ and Rust.\n- Reliability and isolation : WASM filters are deployed into VM and hence they are isolated from the Envoy process. For instance if the WASM filter crashes it will not impact the envoy process.\n- Security : The WASM filter uses a well defined API to connect with the host i.e envoy proxy which can be modified only a limited number of connections.\n- Speed : It is originally used to speed up large web application\n\n### Q: What is Envoy proxy?\n\nAn Envoy is a high performance, programmable L3/L4 and L7 proxy that a number of service mesh use as their data plane. See the [service mesh landscape](https://layer5.io/service-mesh-landscape) for a complete list. Connection and request handling are at the core of Envoy’s focus. Envoy's has a pluggable filter module that allows the incorporation of WebAssembly filters that provide additional traffic filtering intelligence. Often this includes higher order functions such as access control, transformation, data enrichment, auditing and more.\n\n### Q: What is WASM ?\n\nWebAssembly is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run in many different environments, including behind Envoy's Application Binary Interface to extend Envoy with new capabilities. WASM programs are distributed in an efficient portable binary instruction format and embed into isolated execution environments.\n\n### Q: What are the disadvantages of WASM filters to be taken into consideration?\n\nExecution of WASM filters requires system resources. Just as executing the same functionality that your filter provides outside of the WASM virtual machine, resources can include overhead of latency, CPU, and memory. See the [Cloud Native Performance](https://smp-spec.io) project for more detail.\n\n### Q: What is the Envoy Proxy WASM SDK?\n\nEnvoy proxy runs the WASM filter in a stack-based virtual machine so that the filter memory is isolated from the host environment. The interaction between the embedded host i.e. Envoy proxy and the WASM filter are done via call backs and functions by the Envoy Proxy WASM SDK. The Envoy Proxy WASM SDK is implemented in various programming languages like C++, RUST, AssemblyScript and GO(still experimental)\n\n### Q: What is Image Hub ?\n\nImage Hub is a sample application which was first officially demonstrated at DockerCon 2020. This sample application is written to run on consul to explore the WebAssembly (WASM) modules in the Envoy filter. This application is written in the RUST programming language. These modules are used to implement the multi-tenancy or to implement the per user rate limiting in the applications endpoint."

						"content": "Generating Models annotation and existing custom resource definition (CRD) into Meshery. The platform supports generation from URL, csv you can generate models using either the Meshery CLI or the Meshery UI.\n\n## Generate Models Using Meshery CLI\n\n**Step 1: Install Meshery CLI**\n\nBefore you can use the Meshery CLI to generate a [Model](/concepts/logical/models), you must first install it. You can install Meshery CLI by [following the instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/installation#install-mesheryctl).\n\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Model**\n\nModel can generated in 2 different format ```URL, CSV```. A template file is required that contains some required properties: Registrant, Model name, Model DisplayName, Category. The template file is only required when you use URL for generation of model from a crd. This command enable users to import their new models from CRD and existing Meshery Model\n\n\nmesheryctl model generate -f [file/url] \n\n\nThe supported registrant for generating from URL is `github` and `artifacthub`.The URL format must be in this order.\n\n\nRegistrant `Artifacthub`:\n- https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web={ model-name } \n- https://istio-release.storage.googleapis.com/charts/base-1.19.0-alpha.1.tgz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726839249773905&usg=AOvVaw0j88gkt6FOS1LLSRCYq95X \n\nRegistrant `Github`:\n- git:://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/master/deploy/crds\n- https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_controller/releases/download/uffizzi-controller-2.0.1/uffizzi-controller-2.0.1.tgz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726839320133140&usg=AOvVaw2AryFwXIPKFnWRjRRTApzp\n\n\n**Example :**\n\n\nmesheryctl model generate -f \"git:://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/master/deploy/crds\" -t template.json\n\n\n\n**Note:** A `-r` flag is present to skip registaration. If the flag is used then no new model would be registered though they would be generated and stored inside `.meshery/models` directory.\nThe `template.json` can be viewed [here](#).In template.json if the field `isAnnotaion` is true then we would only consider that component as an annotation (svg icon) rather than a normal component.\n\n\n\n**Example :**\n\n\n\nmesheryctl model generate -f \"git:://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/master/deploy/crds\" -t template.json -r\n\n\n\n\n## Generate Models Using Meshery UI\n\n**Step 1: Access the Meshery UI**\n\nTo generate a model into Meshery using the Meshery UI, you must first [install Meshery](/installation/quick-start)\n\n**Step 2: Navigate to Registry under Settings Page**\n\nOnce you have accessed the Meshery UI, navigate to the Registry under Settings. This page can be accessed by clicking on the Settings on the top right on setting icon and then selecting \"Registry\" and then choose model.\n\n\n\n### Step 3: Generate the Model\n\nOn the **Registry** page, you can generate your model by clicking the **Generate** button. You have two options for input: URL or CSV. Below are the steps for both methods:\n\n---\n\n#### **From CSV**\n1. **Upload CSV Files**: You can generate your model by uploading a **components model CSV**. Uploading a **relationships CSV** is optional.\n   \n2. **Template CSV**: If you don’t have a CSV file ready, you can use our [Spreasheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19JEpqvHrG8UL-Bc-An9UIcubf1NVhlfnQSN1TD7JOZ4/) to create one. Simply  fill in your details, download the template as csv, and upload it to generate your model.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### **From URL**\n1. **Paste URL**: Enter the URL of your model. \n\n2. **Fill in Values**: After entering the URL, you will be prompted to fill in the values corresponding to your model's details.\n\n3. **Specify Options**: Lastly, specify if the model is an annotation or if you wish to register it.\n\nOnce you complete these steps, click **Next** to continue with the model generation process.\n\n---"

A sample configuration of the action is shown below.\n\n```yaml\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n```\n\nYou can also define your test configuration in an SMP compatible configuration file as shown below.\n\n```yaml\nsmp_version: v0.0.1\nid:\nname: Istio Performance Test\nlabels: {}\nclients:\n- internal: false\n  load_generator: fortio\n  protocol: 1\n  connections: 2\n  rps: 10\n  headers: {}\n  cookies: {}\n  body: \"\"\n  content_type: \"\"\n  endpoint_urls:\n  - http://localhost:2323/productpage\nduration: \"30m\"\n```\n\nSee this sample GitHub workflow (action.yml) for more configuration details.\n\n\n\nThe results from the tests are updated on the Performance Management dashboard in Meshery. To learn more about interpreting the test results, check out this guide. You can always checkout the Meshery User Guides to dive deep into these features.\n\nService Mesh Performance standardizes service mesh value measurement, characterizing any deployment's performance by capturing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration and workload metadata.\n\n## Service Mesh Conformance GitHub Action (Archived)\n\n\n\nService Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action\n\n\n\n\nService Mesh Interface provides a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. These (currently) four specfications offer a common denominator set of interfaces to support most common service mesh use cases and the flexibility to evolve to support new service mesh capabilities over time.\n\nThe Meshery SMI Conformance Action which validates SMI conformance in your pipeline and the Meshery SMP Action which runs SMP compatible performance benchmarks.\n\nService Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action\n\nConformance of SMI specifications is defined as a series of test assertions. These test assertions are categorised by SMI specification (of which, there are currently four specifications) and comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. Conformance requirements will change appropriately as each new version of the SMI spec is released. Refer to Meshery's documentation for details of how Meshery performs SMI conformance.\n\n\nUsing Meshery's SMI Conformance GitHub Action\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action is available in the GitHub Marketplace. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event.\n\nAn example of the action configuration which runs on every release is shown below. The action handles setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying the service mesh (see supported service meshes), running the conformance tests and reporting back the results to the SMI Conformance dashboard in Meshery.\n\n\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: false\n\n\nYou can also bring in their own cluster with specific capabilities and with a service mesh already installed.\n\n\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - 'master'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance tests on master\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Install OSM\n        run: |\n           curl -LO https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/v0.9.1/osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           tar -xzf osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           mkdir -p ~/osm/bin\n           mv ./linux-amd64/osm ~/osm/bin/osm-bin\n           PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/osm/bin/\"\n           osm-bin install --osm-namespace default\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: true\n\n\nYou can download a token from Meshery and add it as a GitHub secret (in the example above, the secret is MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN). After the test is run, you can view the results from the Service Mesh Interface dashboard in Meshery UI.\n\n \nMeshery's Service Mesh Interface Conformance Results\n\nParticipating service mesh projects can also automatically report their conformance test results to the SMI Conformance dashboard"

atomic values, and do not have fields of their own.\nBasic scalars include strings, boolean values, and numbers. This schema also\ndefines various custom scalar values, such as types for times and dates.\n\nThis schema includes custom scalar types for identifiers, with a specific type for\neach kind of object.\n\nFor more information, read about [Scalar Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) on `graphql.org`.\n\n### `Any`\n\n### `Boolean`\n\nRepresents `true` or `false` values.\n\n### `ID`\n\nRepresents a unique identifier that is Base64 obfuscated. It is often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `\"VXNlci0xMA==\"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.\n\n### `Int`\n\nRepresents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.\n\n### `Map`\n\n### `String`\n\nRepresents textual data as UTF-8 character sequences. This type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.\n\n### `Time`\n\n## Input types\n\nTypes that may be used as arguments (all scalar types may also\nbe used as arguments).\n\nOnly general use input types are listed here. For mutation input types,\nsee the associated mutation type above.\n\nFor more information, read about [Scalar Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types) on `graphql.org`.\n\n### `AddonStatusInput`\n\nInput for changing Addon Status.\n\n#### **Arguments**\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `k8scontextID` | [`String!`](#string) | kubernetes context ID. |\n| `selector` | [`MeshType`](#meshtype) | Filter by Serice Mesh. |\n| `targetStatus` | [`Status!`](#status) | Desired Status. |\n\n### `CatalogSelector`\n\n#### **Arguments**\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `order` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `page` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `page_size` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `search` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n\n### `MeshModelSummarySelector`\n\n#### **Arguments**\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `type` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n\n### `PageFilter`\n\n#### **Arguments**\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `from` | [`String`](#string) |  |\n| `order` | [`String`](#string) |  |\n| `page` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `pageSize` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `search` | [`String`](#string) |  |\n| `to` | [`String`](#string) |  |\n| `updated_after` | [`String`](#string) |  |\n\n### `ReSyncActions`\n\nType ReSyncActions define the actions involved during resync.\n\n#### **Arguments**\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `ReSync` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `clearDB` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n| `hardReset` | [`String!`](#string) |  |\n\n### `ServiceMeshFilter`\n\nFilter Control Plane Query.\n\n#### **Arguments**\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `k8sClusterIDs` | [`[String!]`](#string) |  |\n| `type` | [`MeshType`](#meshtype) | Filter by Service Mesh. |"

						"title": "Helm Kanvas Snapshot",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /extensions/kubectl-kanvas-snapshot",
						"content": "#  Helm Kanvas Snapshot\n\n## Extension Overview\n\nThe **Kanvas Snapshot Helm Plugin** allows users to generate a visual snapshot of their Helm charts directly from the command line. It simplifies the process of creating Meshery Snapshots, providing a visual representation of packaged Helm charts. This plugin integrates with Meshery Cloud and GitHub Actions to automate the workflow of snapshot creation, which is especially useful for Helm users who need to quickly visualize their chart configurations.\n\nHelm charts can be complex, especially when custom configurations are applied via `values.yaml` files. This Meshery extension bridges the gap between Helm chart configurations and their visual representation by converting Helm charts into **Kanvas Snapshots**. These snapshots can be received either via email or as a URL displayed directly in the terminal.\n\n### Features\n\n1. **Snapshot Generation:** Create visual snapshots of Helm charts, complete with associated resources.\n2. **Synchronous/Asynchronous Delivery:** Choose between receiving snapshots via email or directly in the terminal.\n3. **Seamless Integration:** Leverages Meshery Cloud and GitHub Actions to handle snapshot rendering.\n4. **Support for Packaged Charts:** Works with both packaged `.tar.gz` charts and unpackaged Helm charts.\n\n## Installation and Use\n\nTo install the Meshery Snapshot Helm Plugin, use the following steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- `helm` must be [installed]( helm plugin install https://github.com/meshery/helm-kanvas-snapshot) on your system.\n- (Optional) A free [Layer5 Cloud](https://cloud.layer5.io) user account.\n- Environemnt Variables:\n    1. ...?\n\n**Plugin Installation**\n\n1. Run the following command to install the Helm Kanvas Snapshot plugin:\n\n   ```bash\n   helm plugin install https://github.com/meshery/helm-kanvas-snapshot\n   ```\n\n3. Verify the installation by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   helm plugin list\n   ```\n\n   You should see the Kanvas Snapshot listed as `snapshot`.\n\n4. Set up the required environment variables (see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, you can generate a snapshot using either a packaged or unpackaged Helm chart.\n\n```bash\nhelm snapshot -f  [-n ] [-e ]\n```\n\n- **`-f`**, **`--file`**: (required) path or URL to the Helm chart (required).\n- **`-n`**, **`--name`**: (optional) name for the snapshot. If not provided, a name will be auto-generated based on the chart name.\n- **`-e`, **`--email`**: (optional) email address to notify when snapshot is ready. If not provided, a link to the snapshot will be displayed in the terminal.\n\n**Example**\n\nTo generate a snapshot for a Helm chart located at `https://meshery.io/charts/v0.8.0-meshery.tar.gz`, you can use:\n\n```bash\nhelm snapshot -f https://meshery.io/charts/v0.8.0-meshery.tar.gz -n meshery-chart\n```\n\n\n\n## About Meshery Extensions\n\n[Meshery Extensions](https://meshery.io/extension) are plugins or add-ons that enhance the functionality of the Meshery platform beyond its core capabilities. Meshery supports different types of extensions ([docs](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/)):\n\n- [Adapters](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/adapters): Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure.\n- [Load Generators](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/load-generators): for performance characterization and benchmarking\n- [Integrations](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/integrations): model-based support for a broad variety of design and orchestration of cloud and cloud native platforms, tools, and technologies.\n- [Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers): for connecting to different cloud providers and infrastructure platforms\n- [UI Plugins](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/ui): Meshery UI has a number of extension points that allow users to customize their experience with third-party plugins."

						"content": "#  Kanvas BETA\n\nKanvas is a GitOps-infused cloud native visual designer for Kubernetes and cloud native applications. Kanvas works with your Kubernetes clusters so that you design and manage your infrastructure and applications between members of your team. Kanvas has two modes: Designer and Visualizer. Create and share your own Kubernetes deployments and patterns in Kanvas Designer. Deploy your designs and manage your infrastructure using Kanvas Visualizer. It includes multi-user collaboration features that allow teams to work together seamlessly towards achieving their goals in a more timely manner. Kanvas aims at removing all the challenging aspects of collaboration from the equation so that everyone on your team can be on the same page when it comes to managing cloud-native infrastructure projects.\n\n### Guide to use Kanvas' features\n\n- Publishing a Design - Publish your first design.\n- Sharing a Design - Share your design with friends.\n- Import a Design - Importing a design from catalog or locally.\n- Merge Designs - Merging designs.\n- Import an application - Importing an application of different types.\n- Component Shapes - Know what each component shape signify.\n- Edges Shapes - Know what each Edge signifies.\n\n### Kanvas For GitOps\n\nKanvas is a valuable GitOps tool for DevOps teams as it allows them to configure, and manage infrastructure resources. This enables streamlining the process of deploying and undeploying large resources and reduces the time and effort required to set up and maintain environments. Additionally, Kanvas provides features such as visualization, collaboration, and snapshots, which can make cloud native business faster. Kanvas also helps DevOps teams maintain a high level of control, and governance by providing a way to define and manage their infrastructure as code. This reduces human error by overcoming the traditional way of configuring YAMLs and ensures compliance with best practices and industry standards.\n\n### Kanvas For Developers\n\nFor developers, Kanvas is valuable as it enables them to manage their infrastructure in an effortless manner. This allows developers to concentrate on coding and delivering features instead of infrastructure management. Furthermore, Kanvas offers efficient management of multiple Kubernetes clusters and manifests, guaranteeing consistency and up-to-dateness across development, staging, and production environments. This minimizes the potential for errors, workloads, and inconsistencies in the configurations, as it detects clusters automatically. This ensures the infrastructure is always available.\n\nKanvas Designer Walkthrough:\n\n\n\nSee on YouTube: [Kanvas Designer Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaoYRP3oLok)\n\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\nNot finding what you're looking for?

See the complete list of supported platforms in the table below. With service meshes having sprung to life in the context of Kubernetes, so too, can Meshery’s deployment models be characterized in the context of Kubernetes. A given deployment of Meshery can be described as either an in-cluster or an out-of-cluster deployment.

						"content": "#  Kanvas Snapshot\n\nKanvas Snapshot is a screenshot service provided via Kanvas for your designs. Visualize changes to your code-base with each pull request made. The SnapShot GitHub Action is configurable from within your Cloud account.\n\n\nHow the SnapShot service works\n\nFunctional Sequence Diagram\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Kanvas Snapshot: Github Pull Request\n\nConnect MeshMap to your GitHub repo and see changes pull request-to-pull request. Get snapshots of your infrastructure directly in your PRs.\n\nStep 1: Log in to your Meshery Dashboard.\nStep 2: Navigate to Extensions and Enable GitHub Action: Kanvas Snapshot.\nStep 3: You will be directed to Meshery Cloud.\nStep 4: Click on the \"Let's Go\" button in the onboarding modal.\nStep 5: Now, select the second option, 'GitOps your infrastructure with Kanvas Snapshot'.\nStep 6: Once that's complete, follow the guided instructions.\n\n\n## Configurating the SnapShot Service\n\nThe Snapshot service does not need access to your Meshery deployment. It is a standalone service.\n\n### When Infrastructure is located in the file-system\n\n```yaml\nname: \"Kanvas Snapshot With File-located in Fs\"\non: # rebuild any PRs and main branch changes\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - master\n      - \"releases/*\"\n\njobs:\n  test: # make sure the action works on a clean machine without building\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set PR number # To comment the final status on the Pull-request opened in any repository\n        run: |\n          export pull_number=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number \"$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH\")\n          echo \"PULL_NO=$pull_number\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # the repository where your infrastructure is located\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 #this step would go and would be no longer needed to be written\n        with:\n          path: action\n          repository: layer5labs/kanvas-snapshot\n      - id: test_result\n        uses: layer5labs/MeshMap-Snapshot@v0.0.4\n        with:\n          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # github's personal access token example: \"ghp_....\"\n          providerToken: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }} # Meshery Cloud Authentication token, signin to meshery-cloud to get one, example: ey.....\n          prNumber: ${{ env.PULL_NO }} # auto-filled from the above step\n          application_type: \"Kubernetes Manifest\" # your application type, could be any of three: \"Kubernetes Manifest\", \"Docker Compose\", \"Helm Chart\"\n          filePath: \"action/__tests__/manifest-test\" # relative file-path from the root directory in the github-runner env, you might require to checkout the repository as described in step 2\n```\n\n\n### When Infrastructure is identified via URL\n\n```yaml\nname: \"Kanvas Snapshot With URL-Upload\"\non: # rebuild any PRs and main branch changes\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - master\n      - \"releases/*\"\n\njobs:\n  test: # make sure the action works on a clean machine without building\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set PR number # To comment the final status on the Pull-request opened in any repository\n        run: |\n          export pull_number=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number \"$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH\")\n          echo \"PULL_NO=$pull_number\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 #this step would go and would be no longer needed to be written\n        with:\n          path: action\n          repository: layer5labs/kanvas-snapshot\n      - id: test_result\n        uses: layer5labs/MeshMap-Snapshot@v0.0.4\n        with:\n          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # github's personal access token example: \"ghp_....\"\n          providerToken: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }} # Meshery Cloud Authentication token, signin to meshery-cloud to get one, example: ey.....\n          prNumber: ${{ env.PULL_NO }} # auto-filled from the above step\n          application_type: \"Helm Chart\" # your application type, could be any of three: \"Kubernetes Manifest\", \"Docker Compose\", \"Helm Chart\"\n          application_url: \"https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/raw/master/charts/meshery-v0.6.88.tgz\"\n```\n\n#### FileSystem Approach Notes\n\nThe filesystem-approach asks for your relative file-path and automatically merges all the yaml files together to bundle up into one. So you might like to give the root directory where all the yamls are located. It doesn't move recursevely in internal folders, so only the first level yaml files are checked.\n\n## List of Input variables supported:\n\n```yaml\ndesignId: # id of input  #deprecated\n  description: \"The design uuid, example: 3c116d0a-49ea-4294-addc-d9ab34210662\"\n  required: false\n  default: \"{}\"\napplicationId: #deprecated\n  description: \"The application uuid, example: 3c116d0a-49ea-4294-addc-d9ab34210662\"\n  required: false\ngithubToken:\n  description: \"Github PAT token\"\n  required: true\nproviderToken:\n  description: \"Meshery Authentication Provider Token\"\n  required: true\nprNumber:\n  description: \"The Pull request on which comment has to be made\"\n  required: false\n  default: 0\nfilePath:\n  description: \"The relative filepath of the location where the manifests are stored\"\n  required: false\napplication_type:\n  description: \"Application upload type, any of the three, Kubernetes Manifest, Docker Compose, Helm Chart\"\n  required: true\napplication_url:\n  description: \"Application's source url where the manifests or data is stored\"\n  required: false\n```\n\n## Customizing Snapshot Workflow Triggers in Kanvas Snapshot\n\nYou can configure your workflows to run when specific activity on GitHub happens, at a scheduled time, or when an event outside of GitHub occurs.\n\n### About events that trigger workflows\n\nGitHub Actions provides a variety of events that can trigger workflows, allowing you to automate your software development process. Each event corresponds to a specific activity, such as creating a pull request, pushing code to a repository, or releasing a new version.\n\n### Supported Events\n\nThe Kanvas Snapshot Action supports all of the events listed in the GitHub documentation:\nFor detailed information about each event, including its properties and payloads, refer to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).\n\n### Workflow Syntax for Event Filtering\n\nWhen defining workflows, you can use the `on` keyword to specify which events trigger the workflow. You can further filter the triggering conditions by using the `types`, `branches`, `tags`, and other options. For example:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    types:\n      - opened\n      - synchronize\n```\n\nSpecific events that are relevant to the Kanvas Snapshot Action are:\n\n- **push:** This event is triggered when code is pushed to the repository. It is the most common event used to trigger workflows.\n- **pull_request:** This event is triggered when a pull request is opened or updated. It is often used to trigger workflows that run tests or linters on the pull request's code.\n\n- **workflow_dispatch:** This event is triggered when a workflow is manually triggered. It can be used to trigger workflows on demand, such as for publishing a new release or addressing critical bugs.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of events that can be used in GitHub Actions, please refer to the Supported Events section above.\n\n## What Happens to Workflow Customizations on Upgrade?\n\nCustomizations to the trigger criteria for the Kanvas Snapshot actions are preserved when upgrading to a new version of the action. However, there may be some cases where customizations are lost, such as when the syntax for specifying the trigger criteria changes in a new version of the action.\n\nHere are some examples of cases where customizations may be lost:\n\n- You currently have a workflow that is triggered on the push event, and the syntax for specifying the push event changes in a new version of the action.\n\n- You have a workflow that is triggered on a custom event, and the custom event is no longer supported in a new version of the action.\n\nIt is always a good practice to test your workflows after upgrading to a new version of the Kanvas Snapshot Action to make sure that your customizations are still working as expected.\n\n## Usage:\n\nAfter testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action\n\n# General Upgrade Guide\n\n[Kanvas Snapshot Release Page](https://github.com/layer5labs/kanvas-snapshot/releases)\n\n\n```\n - id: test_result\n        uses: layer5labs/MeshMap-Snapshot@v0.0.5 # <-- Update the version to latest from the Kanvas-Snapshot release page\n        with:\n        ...\n```\n\n## Upgrade/Migrate Guide - For Meshery\n\n1. Given changes done in `action.yml` in Kanvas Snapshot, updating the workflows is required.\n2. Given changes done other than in `action.yml` in Kanvas Snapshot, the update in the `.github/worflows` is not a hard requirement, but doesnt hurt."

						"content": "{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"MeshSync\" content=\"Managed by the Meshery Operator, MeshSync is a custom Kubernetes controller that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes clusters and their workloads. Learn more about MeshSync.\" %}\n\nMeshSync is your tool for efficient management and synchronization of Kubernetes clusters! This user guide will walk you through how to establish a connection with any element that Meshery is able to connect to and manage. Use the MeshSync page to register connections, view connection metadata, and perform connectivity tests, as weel as to manage credentials and environments.\n\n## MeshSync Discovery\n\nMeshSync involves the discovery and registration of elements in your infrastructure. Follow these steps to seamlessly integrate and manage your connections:\n\n1. **Discovered**: Fill out the registration form, specifying metrics to listen to for Prometheus.\n2. **Register**: Your object will now appear on the connection page.\n\nTasks performed during registration:\n\n- Enrich connections with more information about your infrastructure.\n- Offload fingerprinting process to MeshSync.\n- Connect with KubeAPI for connections management.\n- Handle curated list of connections (port, protocol, etc.).\n- Display Meshery Models icons/colors for every discovered object with connection definitions pointing to components.\n\n### Meshery Server Database Updates\n\nMeshery Server writes updates from MeshSync to the server database:\n\nMeshery uses the component's Group, Version, Kind to perform the initial tier of fingerprinting. \n\n### MeshSync Endpoint\n\nThe Meshery Server endpoint performs a simple JOIN of GVKs to enrich responses with Component Metadata. Key points to note:\n\n## Connection Management\n\n### During Connection Registration\n\nUpon registration, the MeshSync object should have a status of \"REGISTERED.\" Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new entry in the Connections table with either \"REGISTERED\" or \"CONNECTED,\" based on the Meshery Server's ability to establish a connection.\n2. Use the Registration Modal to assign the connection to an environment.\n3. Confirm connection metadata details, including the assigned model and component.\n4. Perform a connectivity test to determine the status: \"REGISTERED\" (administratively connected) or \"CONNECTED\" (both administratively and actually connected).\n\n### Registration Modal\n\nThe Registration Modal allows users to assign connections to environments, view connection metadata, and perform connectivity tests. Key features include:\n\n- Connectivity test to determine registration status.\n- Identification of credentials to be used, with a selection based on CredentialDefinition for the ConnectionDefinition being registered.\n- Future options to offer generic CredentialDefinitions for various authentication methods.\n\n### Credential Registration\n\nDuring credential registration, users can assign credentials to one or more connections and perform ad hoc connectivity tests. UI buttons include \"Test\" and \"Register.\"\n\n## Connection Configuration\n\nThe benefit of normalizing and extracting the status of a component as a direct property of the connection is to allow different systems to connect to the same component with different states. For example, multiple Meshery servers can connect to the same Kubernetes cluster, each having its own individual connection with a unique status.\n\nNow that you are familiar with MeshSync and its powerful features, you are ready to streamline your Kubernetes cluster management."

						"content": "## Using Meshery Designs to Manage Your Infrastructure\n\nMeshery is a versatile platform designed to streamline the lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of infrastructure across Kubernetes clusters.\n\n### Designs in Meshery\n\nMeshery employs the concept of [Designs]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/designs) as a fundamental construct for managing infrastructure. Designs provide a structured way to organize and deploy various components of your infrastructure. To do so, Meshery utilizes a declarative approach to infrastructure management, similar to Kubernetes manifests. Meshery Designs are written in YAML and are validated against a schema.\n\n#### Importing Existing Infrastructure and Applications\n\nMeshery facilitates the import of infrastructure in multiple formats, including Kubernetes manifests, Helm Charts, and Docker Compose files. Import existing infrastructure definitions by directly from filesystem, via URL, or import directly from a GitHub repository.\n\n- Kubernetes Manifest\n- Meshery Design\n- Helm Charts\n- Docker Compose\n\nSee [Importing Applications]({{site.baseurl}}guides/configuration-management/importing-apps) for more information.\n\n\n\nMeshery Internals Provisioning Process\n\nWhen a request is made to provision a design, it undergoes the following stages:\n1. Import of Referenced Designs\nA Design may reference any number of other Designs, in essence, a Design may import any number of other Designs.  As an editor of a Design, you can make reference to another Design, while following principles of reusing and DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself). Any referenced Design will subsequently be imported during the provisioning moment. To reference another design, do so by adding the following annotation type: $(#use \\) in your Design file. The referenced design will be expanded from the source.\n2. Identification\nMeshery relies on components registered at boot time. Only registered models and components can be managed with Meshery. Currently, models from the ArtifactHub repository are supported.\n3. Validation\nComponents in the design are validated against the schema, ensuring consistency, similar to Kubernetes object validation but tailored for Designs.\n4. Dependency Detection and Resolution\nMeshery identifies and resolves dependencies among components. The order of provisioning is critical for successful deployment, and circular dependencies result in the termination of the request.\n5. Provisioning\nA Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) generated in the previous step is processed. Dependent components are processed sequentially, while others are processed in parallel. Meshery intelligently handles the deployment order to ensure successful deployment.\n\n\nAuto-Deployment of CRDs and Operators\n\nMeshery automates the deployment of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and operators based on the source from which a particular component was registered. Currently, by default Meshery automatically deploys components that are sourced from Artifact Hub (utilizing Helm Charts). (_Support for OCI registries is expected in the near future._)\n\n{% include alert.html title=\"Upcoming Features\" type=\"info\" content=\"Meshery is actively developing the ability to import custom models and components, expanding the platform's flexibility. Support for OCI registries is expected in the near future.\n1. Custom Models and Components:\n  Meshery is actively developing the ability to import custom models and components, expanding the platform's flexibility.\n2. OCI Registry Support:\n  Meshery will soon be adding support for OCI registries in addition to ArtifactHub.\n  \" %}"

						"content": "## Meshery's Preflight Checks\n\nAnytime a `mesheryctl system` command is executed, a series of preflight checks are run. An attempt will be made to connect to the Kubernetes cluster configured in the user's kubeconfig as their current-context .\n\n1. Check whether `mesheryctl` can initialize a Kubernetes client.\n\n   Situation: `mesheryctl` fails to query for pods in the default namespace of the user's current Kubernetes context.\n\n2. Remove `~/.meshery` to reinitialize Meshery\n\n   Situation: Unable to start Meshery Server with `make run-local` due to error of `key/value size is invalid`\n\n## Setting up Meshery using Kind or Minikube\n\nThe difficulty with Minikube and Kind clusters is that they typically don't support LoadBalancer service networking by default. Meshery UI and Meshery Broker are configured for LoadBalancer service networking by default. There are a number of solutions this overcoming this challenge. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. Use the MetalLB Minikube add-on that provides load balancing. `minikube addons enable metallb`\n\n   MetalLB setup: [link](https://kubebyexample.com/learning-paths/metallb/install)\n\n2. Use Minikube tunnel to expose services. `minikube tunnel`.\n\n   Docs: [link](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#using-minikube-tunnel)\n\n   A simpler way to resolve this issue can be `port-forwarding`. Run the following command in terminal:\n\n   `kubectl port-forward service/meshery 9081:9081 -n meshery`\n\n   {% include mesheryctl/system-dashboard.md %}\n\n3. For `kind`, you can prefer installing MetalLB with a custom configmap.\n\n   Docs: [link](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/loadbalancer/)\n\n## Meshery Operator\n\nBy default, Meshery Operator is installed in all the connected clusters automatically once Meshery server detects those clusters. The operator can manually be turned off on particular cluster from the settings page.\n\n### Disabling the operator\n\nThe env variable DISABLE_OPERATOR=true can be used to signal Meshery server to not install operator in any of the clusters at any point in time after starting. While using Meshery server locally, the `make server-without-operator` should be used to start Meshery in disabled operator mode.\n\n### Meshery Broker\n\nExample of a healthy Meshery Broker server with an actively connected (subscribed) Meshery Server:\n\n```shell\n➜  ~ kubectl logs -n meshery meshery-broker-0 nats\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.070952 [INF] Starting nats-server version 2.1.9\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.070982 [INF] Git commit [7c76626]\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071308 [INF] Starting http monitor on 0.0.0.0:8222\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071370 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071512 [INF] Server id is NAAYJNX4LDDNXW5UE7IP7PRQR2W2JP546XSFNUWQQHN7JYY27RG47KSG\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071516 [INF] Server is ready\n```\n\nFor details about the state of the Meshery Server subscription see the http monitor port on Meshery Broker.\n\n### Meshery Unable to Connect to Kubernetes\n\nMeshery is unable to detect the Kubernetes connection running on your local system, even after manually uploading the `.kube config` file\n\nWhen deploying Meshery out-of-cluster, verify your kubeconfig's contexts and the ability for Meshery Server to reach Kubernetes cluster API from whatever host and network that Meshery Server is being deployed on.\n\n\nkubectl config get-contexts\n\n\nIf you're using Docker Desktop, consider whether you need to change your current Kubernetes context to `docker-desktop`.\n\n\nkubectl config use-context\ndocker-desktop\n\n\n## Meshery Remote Providers\n\nOnce Meshery is installed, the remote provider \"Meshery\" can be chosen from UI or by using the command `mesheryctl system login`:\n\n![Providers](/assets/img/providers/provider_screenshot.png)\n\n```bash\n➜  ~ mesheryctl system login\nUse the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←\n? Select a Provider:\n  ▸ Meshery\n    None\n```\n\nIf you cannot see \"Meshery\" Remote Provider and find such error logs in Meshery Server's logs (`mesheryctl system logs`), please make sure that Meshery Server is able to reach \"https://cloud.layer5.io\" in order to initialize the \"Meshery\" Remote Provider.\n\n```bash\ntime=\"2021-11-10T11:05:30Z\" level=error msg=\"[Initialize Provider]: Failed to get capabilities Get \\\"https://cloud.layer5.io/v0.5.71/capabilities?os=meshery\\\": dial tcp 3.140.89.205:443: i/o timeout\"\n```\n\nFor more details about Meshery Providers:\n\n- [Extensibility: Providers](/extensibility/providers)\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Meshery Error Code Reference](/reference/error-codes)"

						"content": "## Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, we will work with Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. _ConfigMaps_ are used to manage configuration data, while _Secrets_ are used for sensitive information such as passwords. Using Meshery Playground, an interactive live cluster environment, we'll perform hands-on exercises to gain practical knowledge into working with these Kubernetes objects.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** If this your fist time working with Meshery Playground start with the [Kubernetes Pods with Meshery](/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Basic understanding of containerization and Kubernetes concepts.\n- Access to the _Meshery Playground_. If you don't have an account, sign up at [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io/).\n\n## Lab Scenario\n\n - Start with an existing design of a simple MySQL pod. \n - Add a _ConfigMap_ to set the database name to be created on MySQL pod deployment.\n - Use a _Secert_ to set the MySQL root password.\n\n## Objective\n\nLearn how to create and manage _Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets_ within the context of a microservices architecture.\n\n## Steps\n\n### Access Meshery Playground\n\n- Log in to the [Meshery Playground](http://playground.meshery.io/) using your credentials. On successful login, you should be at the dashboard. Press the **X** on the _Where do you want to start?_ popup to close it (if required).\n- Click **Kanvas** in the navigation menu to navigate to _Kanvas_.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** Kanvas is still in beta.\n\n### Clone the starter design\n\nFor this tutorial we will start with an existing design and later add _ConfigMap_ and _Secret_ components to it. The design is a simple MySQL pod.\n\nSelect the **Catalog** tab and search for the word _'tutorial'_ (1). Click on the **[Tutorial] Simple MySQL Pod** (2) design and when prompted click **Clone** (3).\n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-17_20-01.png)\n\nLabel the pod with a unique key-value pair for easier filtering later. For example, _user:johndoe_. Use the same key-value pair fot labelling all the other resources. The tutorial uses _environment:tutorial_, do not use the same.\n\n\n### Create and configure a ConfigMap\n\nClick Kubernetes from the dock and select Config Map from the list. This will put the ConfigMap component on the canvas.  \n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_18-03.png)\n\nClick the _ConfigMap_ component to load the configuration window.\n\n 1. Change the **Name** if required. (Using a unique name helps with easier identification later)\n 2. Click **+** next to Data and set the ConfigMap data as a key value pair. In this example, the _Key_ is **CREATEDB** and the _Value_ is **myDB**.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_00-13.png)\n\n 3. Click on the **label**.\n 4. Set a label for easier filtering later during Visualization.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_00-18.png)\n\n 5. Click outside the window to close it. \n\nMake a note of the ConfigMap component _name_ and _key_ for use later.\n\n\n### Create and configure a Secret\n\n Before you proceed, choose a password and convert it into base64 format. Use an online tool to do so. For this example the password is **strongpassword** and the base64 of it is **c3Ryb25ncGFzc3dvcmQ=**\n\nClick Kubernetes from the dock and select Secret from the list. This will put the Secret component on the canvas.  \n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_18-19.png)\n\nClick on the _Secret_ component to load the configuration window.\n\n 1. Set a _name_.\n 2. Set _Type_ as **Opaque**.\n 3. Click **+** next to _Data_ and add the secret as a key value pair. For this tutorial, the _Key_ is **SUPERSECRETPASSWORD** and the _Value_ is **c3Ryb25ncGFzc3dvcmQ=**.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_18-25.png)\n\n 4. Click **Labels**.\n 5. Set the same label as used earlier in the ConfigMap.\n 6. Click outside the window to close it.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_18-26.png)\n\n### Configure the Pod to use the ConfigMap and Secret\n\nClick on the _Pod_ component to load its configuration window. We will set the Secret first and then the ConfigMap. \n\n 1. Scroll down to _Container_ and expand _Containers-0_.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_00-42.png)\n\n 2. Scroll down to _Env_. An existing environment variable for the MySQL root password is already set. We will modify this to retrieve the password from the Secret.\n 3. Expand _Env-0_ and delete the contents of _Value_.\n 4. Expand _Value From_, expand _Secret Key Ref_ and set the _Key_ to the name of the key in the Secret and the _Name_ to the name of the Secret which in this example is **SUPERSECRETPASSWORD** and **mysql-secret-eb**.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_00-56.png)\n\n 5. Next, click **+** next to Env to add a second environment variable. \n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_00-57.png)\n\n 6. Expand _Env-1_ and set _Name_ to **MYSQL_DATABASE**.\n 7. Expand _Value From_, expand _Secret Key Ref_ and set the _Key_ to the name of the key in the ConfigMap and the _Name_ to the name of the ConfigMap which in this example is **CREATEDB** and **mysql-config-map-by**.\n\n    ![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_01-00.png)\n\n\n### Validate and Deploy the Design\n\nClick **Actions** and then Select **Validate** to ensure there are no errors. Then, select the **Deploy** tab on the same window and click **Deploy**.\n\n### Verify the Secret and the ConfigMap\n\nMove to the Visualize tab.\n\nFilter to show the resources pod, configmap and secret and use the lables set earlier to display only your resources. In this example, that is _environment:tutorials_.\n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_01-19.png)\n\nSelect the Pod (1) and then choose Actions (2) to the right. Click Open Interactive Terminal (3) to open the terminal to the container.\n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_01-25.png)\n\nRun the following command in the terminal to verify that you are able to use the MySQL root password set as secret to login to MySQL. When prompted enter the root password (in plain text), i.e. _strongpassword_ for this tutorial.\n\n`mysql -uroot -p` \n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_01-27.png)\n\nRun the following MySQL command to verify that the database set as a ConfigMap was indeed created.\n\n`show databases;`\n\n![Configure the ConfigMap](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-configmaps-secrets/2024-04-16_01-29.png)\n\n### Deleting the resources\n\nTo delete the resources, use the **Undeploy** option from the _Design_ view.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations! You've successfully completed a tutorial on Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets using the Meshery Playground. This hands-on experience should have equipped you with practical knowledge on managing configuration data and sensitive information in Kubernetes. Continue exploring more such scenarios in the Meshery Playground to enhance your skills."

						"categories": "",
						"url": " /guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods",
						"content": "### Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll learn the fundamentals of Pods, the smallest deployable units in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Using Meshery Playground, an interactive live cluster environment, we'll perform hands-on labs to gain practical experience in deploying, managing, and understanding some of the concepts related to Pods.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** This tutorial demonstrates stand alone pods, i.e. pods not managed through deployments.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Basic understanding of containerization and Kubernetes concepts.\n- Access to the _Meshery Playground_. If you don't have an account, sign up at [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io/).\n\n### Lab Scenario\n\nDeploy and explore an NGINX pod in a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, expose the pod through a service.\n\n### Objective\n\nLearn how to create, manage, and explore _Kubernetes Pods and Services_ within the context of a microservices architecture.\n\n### Steps\n\n#### Access Meshery Playground\n\n- Log in to the [Meshery Playground](https://cloud.layer5.io/) using your credentials. On successful login, you should be at the dashboard. Press the **X** on the _Where do you want to start?_ popup to close it (if required).\n- Click **Explore** in the Cloud Native Playground tile to navigate to _Kanvas_.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** Kanvas is still in beta.\n\n#### Create a simple stand-alone Pod\n\n1. In the Kanvas screen, rename the design from _Untitled Design_ to a name of choice. This helps in identifying the design later easily.\n2. Click **Components** tab.\n3. Search for **Pod** in the list of components.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-22_18-20.png)\n4. Scroll down, _select and drag_ the **Pod** component from the search results to the design canvas on the right.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-22_18-32.png)\n5. You should now have a pod in the design canvas for further configuration. It has a default name assigned to it.\n    Click the pod component to load the configuration modal.\n6. Rename the pod, if necessary.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-22_18-35.png)\n\n#### Add a container to the Pod\n\nThe pod at this stage does not have a container, so we will add one. This is similar to defining the containers in the _spec:_ section of a YAML file. For this hands-on we will make some basic and necessary configurations only.\n\n7. Scroll down within the Pod configuration modal to the Containers section. Click **+** to add a container.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-23_11-54.png)\n8. Expand **Containers-0**.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-23_11-54_1.png)\n9. Next, fill out some of the required container specifications. Start by entering the container image, we will use _nginx:latest_ for this exercise.\n10. Give the container a name.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-23_11-57.png)\n11. Additionally, we will also give it a label. This will server many advantages later in this exercise. To do so, click the label icon on the modal.\n12. Click **+** next to _Labels_.\n13. Set any label of choice. Preferably, give a unique label since the playground is a shared environment.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-25_18-18.png)\n14. Click outside to close the modal.\n\n#### Validating and Deploying the Pod\n\nThe next step in this process is to validate the design, after which we can deploy it.\n\nTo do this, click **Validate** on the top.\n![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-23_19-52.png)\n\nThis should show a pop-up with details such as the number of components, annotations and errors (if any).\n![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-23_19-54.png)\n\nEnsure there are no errors before deploying. To deploy, click the **Deploy** (1) tab in the pop-up modal and then click **Deploy** (2) again.\n![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-23_19-56.png)\n\nYou should see a few alerts on the bottom right about the deployment.\n\n#### Visualizing the Pod\n\nTo view the resources deployed we will use the **Visualize** section of the _Kanvas_. A view is created with necessary filters to show the relevant resources.\n\n1.  Click **Visualize** to begin.\n2.  Give the view a name (rename).\n3.  Click the filter icon.\n4.  Choose appropriate filters, for this hands-on choose the label that was set earlier during the pod creation. This helps in showing limited resources in the view.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-25_18-22.png)\n\nClick the filter icon again to close. This should show a filtered view with only your resources something similar to the screenshot below:\n![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-25_18-25.png)\n\n#### Pod state and information\n\nSelect the **Details** tab and select the pod from the view to view details about the pod.\nThe details tab shows the following:\n\n- Pod state, a green check means **running**.\n- The namespace where the pod is running.\n- Image details of the container in the pod like image tag and name.\n- It also shows the number of restarts and uptime.\n\n![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-25_17-38.png)\n\n#### Connecting to the Pods / containers\n\nMeshery Playground provides terminal capabilities to connect to the container(s) and stream logs. The following steps demonstrate this.\n\n1.  Select the **Pod** (or container). If you have multiple containers in a pod, select a container.\n2.  Select the **Actions** tab to the right.\n3.  Click **Open Interactive Terminal**.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-05.png)\n    This displays the terminal on the screen.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-10.png)\n4.  To view streaming logs, click **Stream Container Logs** to the right and an additional logs view is added to the terminal window.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-11.png)\n\n#### Exposing a Pod with a Service\n\n> **_NOTE:_** As of this writing, Meshery Playground supports only NodePort at the moment.\n\n1.  Go back to the _Design_ view.\n2.  From **Components** search for _service_ and the drag the service component to the design canvas.\n3.  Click the _service_ component to load the configuration modal.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-33.png)\n4.  Rename it if required.\n5.  Change _Type_ to **NodePort** for this tutorial.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-35.png)\n6.  Click **+** to add a Port.\n7.  Expand the **Ports-0** service port to make changes.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-37.png)\n8.  For this tutorial we set the **Target Port** value to 80.\n9.  We also set the **Port** value to 80.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-45.png)\n10. Click **+** next to Selector and add the key value pair **app:9870**. This is the same pair that is used as label in the Pod.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-48.png)\n11. Finally label this service too, with the same key value pair. This also helps in filtering resources specific to us in the Visualize screen.\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-28_11-53.png)\n12. Move your mouse over the service component until you see the green dots on all four sides. Move your mouse over one of the green dots to reveal an arrow, then click the arrow. Select **Network** option, and then move your mouse to the pod to create the _relationship_. It should look similar to the screenshot below:\n    ![](/pages/guides/tutorials/kubernetes-pods/2024-02-29_20-37.png)\n13. Validate the design. Click **Validate** from the top menu to do so.\n\n#### Updating the deployment\n\nIn order to apply the updated design (which contains a service now), we must undeploy and deploy the design.\n\n- Select **Undeploy** and click **Undeploy** again.\n- To deploy the updated components, select **Deploy** and click **Deploy**.\n\n#### Deleting and Recreating Pods\n\nTo delete the resources such as Pods, use the **Undeploy** option from the _Design_ view.\n\nTo recreate, use the **Deploy** option.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You've successfully completed the lab on exploring Kubernetes Pods using Meshery Playground. This hands-on experience should have provided valuable insights into the deployment, management, and interaction with Pods in a Kubernetes environment. Continue exploring more scenarios in the Meshery Playground to enhance your skills."

						"content": "Meshery manages hundreds of different types of cloud native infrastructure. See the [full set of integrations](/integrations).\n\n## Cloud Native Infrastructure Lifecycle Management\n\n[![Lifecycle Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lifecycle-management/states-for-kubernetes-cluster-connections.svg)](/assets/img/lifecycle-management/states-for-kubernetes-cluster-connections.svg)\n\nMeshery Adapters can optionally be deployed to provide deep support of different types of infrastructure, so that you can learn and compare different infrastructure functionality. Once you have selected to operate a given infrastructure, Meshery will assist you with ongoing operations.\n\nMeshery automates the provisioning of various infrastructurees, allowing users to select different configuration profiles in order to support a variety of deployment models.\n\nMeshery adapters will dynamically retrieve the specific infrastructure's release package upon initial deployment of a given infrastructure. Meshery adapters cache (in `.meshery/bin`) the infrastructure installation package.\n\n#### Deprovisioning infrastructure\n\nJust as Meshery automates the provisioning of various cloud native infrastructure, so too does it facilitate the deprovisioning of infrastructure. Find the \"Undeploy\" button in Meshery UI or the `--undeploy` flag in Meshery CLI.\n\n## Workload Lifecycle Management\n\nUsers may bring their applications (perform workload onboarding) on the infrastructure using the Custom Configuration operation.\n\nCommonly adjoining each infrastructure is a sample application that facilitates demonstration of the value of the given infrastructure. Meshery allows you to efficiently [install sample applications]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/sample-apps) across different infrastructurees.\n\n## Configuration Management\n\nMeshery provides the ability for you as a infrastructure manager to customize your infrastructure deployment.\n\n## Notifications\n\nMeshery tracks operations that you perform on infrastructurees and their workloads. Meshery provides notification of environment issues, application conflicts with infrastructure configuration, and so on.\n\n#### Acknowledging and dismissing notifications\n\nDepending upon the severity of the notification, many notifications are informational and can readily be dismissed after reading. Some notifications include actionable alerts. Learn more in \"[Managing Events with Notification Center]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/events-management)\".\n\n## Lifecycle FAQs\n\n\n\nQuestion: “Meshery is a collaboration platform. When I bring my infrastructure under Meshery's management, will my Kubernetes clusters be available to all other users? Can other people access my cluster?\nAnswer: Yes, they can, IF you explicitly allow them to do so. It's important to understand the following controls and system behavior:\n1. Ownership: Every connection to a Kubernetes cluster is created by and owned by the individual that provided the Kubernetes context. That individual may elect to share the connection with others on their team (if you have invited anyone to your team(s)).\n2. Permission: If you do grant other team members access, you do so by creating an environment, assigning that Kubernetes connection to the environment, then creating a workspace and assigning that environment to the workspace. Users of any of your teams to which you have shared access to the workspace will then have permission to access the cluster.\n3. Connectivity: those individuals will have to be afforded network connectivity to that cluster (in whatever fashion you deem appropriate). Grossly, there are two ways in which this can occur:\n3.a) The other user runs their own copy of Meshery (or signs into a shared instance like the Playground) and will see the connection as being available when they sign in. Their Meshery Server will need to be able to reach your Kube API over the network. How that is done can be any number of ways and is left unto your own devices.\n3.b.) The other user signs into your Meshery Server instance, which has network access to your Kubernetes cluster. In order for the other user to sign into your Meshery Server, you would have to expose it to the Internet or VPN or… one of the many other ways to all them access to your Meshery Server.\nSo, in short, yes, you can share access to your Kubernetes cluster with other users, but you have to explicitly grant them access to do so.

						"content": "Users may prefer to use one load generator over the next given the difference of capabilities between load generators, so Meshery provides a `load generator interface` (a gRPC interface) behind which a load generator can be implemented. Meshery provides users with choice of which load generator they prefer to use for a given performance test. Users may configure their own preference for the load generator, different from the default load generator.\n\n### What function do load generators in Meshery provide? \n\nLoad generators will provide the capability to run load tests from Meshery. As of today the load generators are embedded as libraries in Meshery and Meshery invokes the load generators APIs with the right load test options to run the load test. At the moment, Meshery supports HTTP load generation. Support for gRPC and TCP load generation is on the roadmap. Meshery has functional integration with fortio, wrk2, and nighthawk.\n\n### Why support multiple load generators?\n\nDifferent use cases and different opinions call for different approaches to statistical analysis of the performance results. For example, wrk2 accounts for a concept called Coordinated Omission.\n\n### Which load generators does Meshery support?\n\n1. [fortio](https://github.com/fortio/fortio) - Fortio load testing library, command line tool, advanced echo server and web UI in go (golang). Allows to specify a set query-per-second load and record latency histograms and other useful stats.\n1. [wrk2](https://github.com/giltene/wrk2) - A constant throughput, correct latency recording variant of wrk.\n1. [nighthawk](https://getnighthawk.dev/) - Enables users to run distributed performance tests to better mimic real-world, distributed systems scenarios.\n  - See the Nighthawk project."

Saving Test Configurations\n2. Create schedules for running tests automatically.\n3. Meshery offers UI for describing the schedules which are as powerful as CRON but without the hassle of remembering its syntax!\n4. All the tests performed are under Profiles which has multiple advantages like:\n   - Access test results ran under a certain profiles at one place.\n   - If running ad-hoc tests, user can anytime come back and rename the performance profiles for re-use.\n\n## Load Generators\n\nMeshery provides users with a choice about the kind of load generator they prefer to use for a given performance test. Users may set their configure based on their own preference of load generator different from that of the default load generator.\n\nMeshery supports the following load generators and is [extendible](extensibility) to support others:\n\n- [fortio](#fortio)\n- [wrk2](#wrk2)\n- [Nighthawk](#nighthawk)\n\n### fortio\n\nFortio is a fast, small (3Mb docker image, minimal dependencies),\nreusable, embeddable go library as well as a command line tool and server process,\nthe server includes a simple web UI and graphical representation of the results\n(both a single latency graph and a multiple results comparative min, max, avg, qps and percentiles graphs).\n\n### wrk2\n\nIt is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.\n\n### Nighthawk\n\nNightHawk is an L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool. It currently offers:\n\n- A load testing client which supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 over HTTP and HTTPS. (HTTPS certificates are not yet validated).\n- A simple test server which is capable of generating dynamic response sizes, as well as inject delays.\n- A binary to transform nighthawk output to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards.\n\n## Configuring performance testing settings\n\nMeshery provides a highly configurable set of load profiles with various, tuneable facets, including support for generating TCP, gRPC, and HTTP load with optional configuration of the performance test's:\n\n- Duration\n- Concurrent Threads\n- Concurrent Generators\n- Load Generator Type\n- Custom HTTP Headers\n\nSee [Cloud Native Performance](https://smp-spec.io) for a full description of the different types of performance tests that Meshery provides.\n\n### Using Performance Test Profiles\n\nAs Meshery user you can customize and save your load test configuration in the form of a Performance Test Profile. Using Performance Test Profiles, you can return to Meshery to run the same set of customized tests again and again, tracking variations in performance overtime.\n\n### Comparing Test Results and Different Configurations\n\nMeshery users can easily compare the difference in request performance (latency and throughput) between independent performance tests. Statistical analysis is run upon finalization of every performance test and presented in the form of a histogram with latency buckets.\n\n## Kubernetes Cluster and Workload Metrics\n\nMeshery provides performance test results alongside environment metrics, including control and data plane metrics as well as cluster node resource metrics, so that operators may easily understand the overhead of their control plane and data plane in context of the overhead incurred on nodes within the cluster.\n\n### Grafana and Meshery\n\nConnect Meshery to your existing Grafana instance. Meshery will auto-import the boards of your choosing:\n\n\n    \n\n\n### [Connecting to Grafana]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/meshery-metrics#expose-grafana-service)\n\nIf you have an API key configured to restrict access to your Grafana boards, you will need to enter the API key when establishing Meshery's connection to Grafana. You may also set up a [Grafana board](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/http_api/dashboard/#create-update-dashboard) and then set up an API key:\n\n- Import Grafana boards\n  - Import existing Grafana boards via API\n  - Import custom Grafana board via yaml\n- Configure graph panel preferences\n\n### [Prometheus and Meshery]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/meshery-metrics#expose-prometheus-service)\n\nMeshery allows users to connect to one or more Prometheus instances in order to gather telemetric data (in the form of metrics). These metrics may pertain to Kubernetes and applications or any other metric that Prometheus has collected.\n\nOnce you have connected Meshery to your Prometheus deployment(s), you may perform ad-hoc connectivity tests to verify communication between Meshery and Prometheus."

						"content": "{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"What is Meshery Operator?\" content=\"Meshery Operator controls and monitors the lifecycle of components deployed inside Meshery-managed Kubernetes clusters. Learn more about Meshery's architecture.\" %}\n\nThis guide offers comprehensive for troubleshooting instructions for [Meshery Operator]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/architecture/operator) and its custom controllers, [MeshSync]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/architecture/meshsync) and [Broker]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/architecture/broker). Follow the steps outlined in this document to ensure a smooth Meshery deployment.\n\nFirst, understand the [Meshery Operator Deployment Scenarios](#meshery-operator-deployment-scenarios) and the [Status of Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Meshery Broker](#understanding-the-status-of-meshery-operator-meshsync-and-meshery-broker) to identify the deployment model fitting of your environment. Then, follow the guidance under the respective scenario to troubleshoot accordingly.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"dark\" title=\"Meshery Error Code Reference\" content=\"Have specific error with an error code? See the Meshery Error Code Reference for probable cause and suggested remediations.\" %}\n\n## Understanding the Status of Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Meshery Broker\n\nEach Meshery Operator controller offers a health status that you can use to understand their current health in your deployment. Their health statuses and meanings are described below.of MeshSync and Meshery Broker.\n\n### MeshSync Health Status\n\n- **ENABLED:** Custom Resource present. MeshSync Controller is not connected to Broker.\n- **DEPLOYED:** Custom Resource present. MeshSync Controller is present but the state is not RUNNING or ERRDISABLE, though\n- **RUNNING:** MeshSync pod present and in a running state.\n- **CONNECTED:** Deployed and connected to Broker.\n- **UNDEPLOYED:** Custom Resource not present.\n\n### Meshery Broker Health Status\n\n- **DEPLOYED:** External IP not exposed OR External IP exposed but Meshery Server is not connected as a client to Broker hence data is not being published.\n- **UNDEPLOYED:** Custom Resource not deployed.\n- **CONNECTED:** Deployed, sending data to Meshery Server.\n\n## Meshery Operator Deployment Scenarios\n\nBecause Meshery is versatile in its deployment models, there are different of scenarios in which you may need to troubleshoot the health of Meshery Operator. Identify the deployment model fitting of your environment and follow the guidance under the respective scenario to troublshoot accordingly.\n\n### In-Cluster Deployment\n\n\n\nWhether using [`mesheryctl system start`]({{site.baseurl}}/installation), [`helm install`]({{site.baseurl}}/installation/kubernetes/helm) or `make run-local`, Meshery Server will automatically connect to any available Kubernetes clusters found in your kubeconfig (under `$HOME/.kube/config`). Once connected, operator, broker(NATS) and meshsync will automatically get deployed in the same clusters.\n\nIf everything is fine, by viewing the connection in Meshery UI, MeshSync should be in **CONNECTED:** state. Otherwise, check the Operator's pod logs:\n\n`kubectl logs  -n meshery`\n\n### Out-of-Cluster Deployment\n\n1. Meshery Server is deployed on any Docker host (- Meshery Server is deployed on a Docker host, and Meshery Operator is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster).\n   _or_\n2. Meshery is managing multiple clusters, some of which are not the cluster unto which Meshery Server is deployed.\n\n## Common Failure Scenarios\n\nSome common failure situations that Meshery users might face are described below.\n\n1. **Situation:** No deployment of Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Broker.\n   1. **Probable cause:** Meshery Server cannot connect to Kubernetes cluster; cluster unreachable or kubeconfig without proper permissions needed to deploy Meshery Operator; Kubernetes config initialization issues.\n1. **Situation:** Meshery Operator with MeshSync and Broker deployed, but Meshery Server is not receiving data from MeshSync or data the [Meshery Database]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/architecture/database) is stale.\n   1. **Probable cause:** \n   2. Meshery Server lost subscription to Meshery Broker; Broker server not exposed to external IP; MeshSync not connected to Broker; MeshSync not running; Meshery Database is stale.\n   3. The SQL database in Meshery serves as a cache for cluster state. A single button allows users to dump/reset the Meshery Database.\n   4. Orphaned MeshSync and Broker controllers - Meshery Operator is not present, but MeshSync and Broker controllers are running.\n\n## Operating Meshery without Meshery Operator\n\nMeshery Operator, MeshSync, and Broker are crucial components in a Meshery deployment. Meshery can function without them, but some functions of Meshery will be disable / unusable. Whether Meshery Operator is initially deployed via `mesheryctl` command or via Meshery Server, you can monitor the health of the Meshery Operator deployment using either the CLI or UI clients.\n\n## Verifying the Status of Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Meshery Broker\n\n## Troubleshooting using Meshery CLI\n\nThe following commands are available to troubleshoot Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Broker.\n\n**Meshery Server and Adapters**\n\n- `mesheryctl system status` - Displays the status of Meshery Server and Meshery Adapters.\n\n**Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Broker**\n\n- `mesheryctl system check` - Displays the status of Meshery Operator, MeshSync, and Broker.\n\n## Troubleshooting using Meshery UI\n\nBased on discussed scenarios, the UI exposes tools to perform the following actions:\n\n- (Re)deploy Operator, MeshSync, Broker.\n- Uninstall and Install MeshSync, Broker, Operator.\n- Reset Database.\n- Ad hoc Connectivity Test for Operator, Meshery Broker, MeshSync.\n- Reconnect Meshery Server to Meshery Broker.\n- Ad hoc Connectivity Test for Kubernetes context.\n- Rediscover kubeconfig, delete, (re)upload kubeconfig.\n\n### Synthetic Test for Ensuring Change in Cluster State\n\nInitiate a synthetic check to verify a fully functional Operator deployment, testing MeshSync/Broker connectivity.\n\n- Empty database shows the main-cluster node.\n- Corrupt database triggers an error snackbar with a link to the Settings screen.\n- Disconnected Kubernetes displays MeshSync logo pulsating when data is received.\n\n\nFuture Enhancements for Troubleshooting:\n\n- NATS/MeshSync not running prompts a review of available operations in the Settings panel.\n\n\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Troubleshooting Meshery Installations](/guides/troubleshooting/installation)\n- [Troubleshooting Errors while running Meshery](guides/troubleshooting/meshery-server)\n\n{% include related-discussions.html tag=\"meshery\" %}"

						"content": "As a new contributor, you’re going to want to familiarize with the project in order to resolve the issues in the best way. Installing and playing around with Meshery will give you context for any issues that you might work on.\n\nOnce an issue has been addressed, you’ll need to test it as well. Ideally, these tests are run from the user’s perspective (someone running Meshery in a container), not from a contributor’s perspective (someone running Meshery as a locally-compiled service).\n\nCompiling and Running Meshery server\n\nTo build and run Meshery server from source:\n\n\n  Build the static assets for the UI by running\n\n\n\n\nmake ui-setup\nmake ui-build\n\n\n\n\n  Build &amp; run the server code by running\n\n\n\n\nmake server\n\n\n\nAny time changes are made to the Go code, you will have to stop the server and run the above command again.\nOnce the Meshery server is up and running, you should be able to access Meshery on your localhost on port 9081 at http://localhost:9081. One thing to note, you might NOT see the Meshery UI until the UI code is built as well.\nAfter running Meshery server, you will need to select your Cloud Provider by navigating to localhost:9081. Only then you will be able to use the Meshery UI on port 3000.\n\nPlease note: If you get error while starting the server as “Meshery Development Incompatible” then follow the below guideline 👇\n\n\n  \n\n\nPotential Solution:\n\n\n  \n    Go to your meshery folder in your local-system where you’ve cloned it.\nExecute:\n  \n  git remote add upstream https://github.com/meshery/meshery\n  git fetch upstream\n  Restart the meshery server\n  Additionally, before restarting the server, if you like to pull the latest changes, you can do: git pull upstream master\n\n\nBuilding Docker image\n\nTo build a Docker image of Meshery, please ensure you have Docker installed to be able to build the image. Now, run the following command to build the Docker image:\n\n\n\nmake docker\n\n\n\nDefine and validate errors\n\nEvery Golang-based component within the Meshery ecosystem incorporates a utility to define and manage error messages for every error instance. This is internally done with several make commands, but one can explicitly validate with the help of the following make command. This checks and validates the errors that are present in the particular project.\n\n\n\nmake error\n\n\n\nFor more details, Error Utility\n\nConfiguring Log levels at Runtime\n\nThe server log levels can be configured at runtime by changing the env variable LOG_LEVEL defined in file server-config.env. The configuration library (viper) watches for the env file, any change in the file content results in the file_system event to be emitted and the log level is updated accordingly.\n\nShould there be any alterations to the location or name of the environment file, it will result in the inability to configure log levels during runtime. In the event of such modifications, it is essential to update the server to preserve proper functionality.\n\n```Available Meshery Server log levels are:\n\n  Panic - 0\n  Fatal - 1\n  Error - 2\n  Warn  - 3\n  Info  - 4\n  Debug - 5\n  Trace level - 6\n```\n\n\nThe default setting for the LOG_LEVEL is 4 (Info). However, if the DEBUG environmental variable is configured as TRUE, it supersedes the value set in the LOG_LEVEL environmental variable, and the logging level is then adjusted to 5(Debug).\n\nUsing custom Meshkit code for Meshery server development\n\n\n  \n    Checkout meshery and meshkit repository in adjacent directories.\n    \n    \n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/meshery/meshery.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/meshery/meshkit.git\n    \n\n\n  \n  \n    In your meshery go.mod, update the meshkit package.\n    \n    \n\n\ngithub.com/layer5io/meshkit =&gt; ../meshkit\n    \n\n\n    Remember to remove this go.mod change when creating pull requests."

The same instructions can be followed as already documented.\n\nEssentially, all three platforms require the same prerequisites but the Linux platforms (as there are more than one of them) come with some of the prerequisites that Windows does not.\n\nIn general, all three require that Docker and Kubernetes are present. If Docker Desktop is installed, then Docker actually uses Hyper-V to install a VM. For the requisite images, both Linux and Windows containers are required depending on what one wants to do but the Linux images are certainly required. This is where the exception that was mentioned earlier comes into play, that is if a Kubernetes elsewhere is used. This installation is specified in the config file in the .kube directory in the home directory.\n\nPrerequisite Dependencies\n\nAll three platforms require the following prerequisites:\n\n\n  make\n  gcc\n  nodejs (for npm)\n  go\n\n\nUsing WSL2\n\nHere is a link to setting up WSL2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\n\nOn Windows Native Mode\n\nInstalling Meshery on native Windows may be a little more involved than installing Meshery on a Linux platform. That is because Linux installations usually come with a lot of the prerequisites preinstalled. Moreover, one is given a hint on the Linux platform on what to do next including the command, especially on Ubuntu.\n\nOn Windows, make, gcc and some of the other prerequisites do not come pre-installed, These will need to be installed manually. Also, after installing any of the items, it may be necessary to set its path. This can be done in the control panel by searching for setting the system environment variables.\n\nPlease research the internet to install these components. However, here are a few suggestions:\n\n\n  make: https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm\n  gcc: https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html\n  nodejs (for npm): https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows\n  go: https://go.dev/doc/install\n\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe following minimum Windows build versions are required:\n\n  \n    Name\n    Version \n  \n  \n    WSL1\n    x64 - Windows 7 \n  \n  \n    WSL2\n    x64 - Version 1903, Build 18362; ARM 64 - Version 2004, Build 19041\n  \n  \n    Custom Kernel\n    Build 18945\n  \n  \n    Kernel with K8s required modules\n    Build 19013\n  \n\n\nNote\nRun the following command on Powershell to check your Windows build and version:\n\n [System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version\n \nSteps\nPerform the following steps in order:\n\n1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\n\nOpen Powershell in administrator mode and run:\n\n\n dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\nRestart-Computer\n \n\nChoosing your WSL version:\n\nWSL2 (Recommended)\nSet the default version to WSL2, which will be inherited by any distro you wish to use.\n\nEnable VM (Virtual Machine) feature:\nOpen PowerShell in administrator mode and run:\n\n\n dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n \n\nSet WSL2 as the default version:\n\n\n wsl --set-default-version 2\n \n\n WSL1 \n\nWarning:\nIt is recommended to update to WSL2 as WSL1 doesn’t support the Docker Desktop application for Windows. Instead, it only supports the deprecated version, Docker Toolbox.\n\nIf you still wish to continue, follow the instructions for WSL1\n\n\n\n1. The default version of WSL is set to WSL1 by default. You can move forward to install the distro of your choice. \n\n2. Docker Toolbox \n\nWarning: Docker Toolbox is a deprecated version. It is recommended to update your system and install the Docker Desktop application with WSL2. \n\nDocker Toolbox uses Linux-specific kernel features, and can’t run natively on Windows. Instead, it creates and uses a small Linux VM on your machine along with docker-machine, and uses VirtualBox to run Docker. \n    \n         Go to Toolbox Releases and download the latest release .exe file \n        Follow these instructions to successfully set up the Docker Toolbox application. \n    \n\n\n\n\n2. Install a new distro\nIn this tutorial, Ubuntu 18.04 will be the distro used. Feel free to use any distro of your choice.\n\nNote: If you choose to run Meshery without installing a distro, skip step 2.\n\n3. Enable Docker\n\nThe Docker Desktop application for Windows includes a comprehensive set of tools, including Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Notary, Kubernetes, and a Credential Helper.\n\n\n  \n    Windows 10 Version\n    Docker Desktop \n  \n  \n    Pro/Education/Enterprise\n    Docker Desktop for Windows Pro\n  \n  \n    Home\n    Docker Desktop for Windows Home\n  \n\n\nUsing Hyper-V to install a linux VM\n\nHere is a link to install linux VM using Hyper-V: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hyper-V\n\nGit Bash\nGit Bash is a terminal emulator which provides git command line experience. This will make working with git easier. You can download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n\nGet the code\n\n\n  Fork and then clone the Meshery repository\n    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/meshery"

						"content": "MeshSync\n        \n        Managed by the Meshery Operator, MeshSync is a custom Kubernetes controller that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of managed multi-cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\n        \n    \n\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Greenfield and Brownfield Support**: MeshSync discovers and identifies infrastructure whether you're starting from scratch (greenfield) with Meshery performing the initial deployment of your infrastructure or bringing in Meshery to manage your existing infrastructure (brownfield).\n- **Real-time / Event-driven Status**: MeshSync subscribes for updates from your platform and listens for state changes, understanding that changes to managed infrastructure may be done out of band of Meshery.\n- **Scalable and Performant**: Meshery's event-driven approach ensures speed and scalability. You have control over the depth of object discovery to manage large clusters efficiently. MeshSync's working snapshot of the state of each cluster under management is stored in the Server's local database and continuously refreshed.\n\n## Discovery\n\nMeshSync supports both greenfield and brownfield discovery of infrastructure. Greenfield discovery manages infrastructure created and managed entirely by Meshery, while brownfield discovery identifies separately created infrastructure.\n\n### Brownfield: Discovering existing resources\n\nThe resources that are present inside the cluster are discovered efficiently with the help of pipelines. The data is constructed in a particular format specific to Meshery and published across to different parts of the architecture.\n\n### Greenfield: Tracking newly created resources\n\nMeshery earmarks infrastucture for which it is the original lifecycle manager. In other words, Meshery tags the resources it creates. In Kubernetes deployments, earmarking is performed using annotations, notably the key/value pair:\n\n`designs.meshery.io: `\n\nThe propagation of the labels and annotations to the native k8s resources would be the responsibility of the workload/trait implementor.\nThe following annotations are added to resources that are created by Meshery Server.\n\n```yaml\nLabels:\n  - resource.pattern.meshery.io/id= # unique identifier for the design\n```\n\n## Identifying Infrastructure under Management\n\nSupplied by Meshery Server, MeshSync uses composite fingerprints to uniquely and positively identify managed infrastructure, capturing essential characteristics like versions and configurations.\n\n### Composite Fingerprints\n\nFingerprinting, the process of positively identifying and classifying resources, is performed using a set of pre-defined attributes that have been designated as unique to that type of resource. For example:\n\n- Prometheus typically offers metrics on 9090/tcp, but not always.\n- Prometheus is typically deployed from a prebuilt container offered by the open source project, but not always.\n\nSee Connnection State Management for additional information.\n\nFingerprinting is the act of uniquely identifying managed infrastructure, their versions and other specific characteristics.\n\nAs a guiding principal, each set of composite fingerprints uses the same identifiers that each element management tool uses to identify itself (e.g., istioctl version).\n\nCreating a composite set of keys involves using the builder pattern. For example:\n\n- Images\n- CRDs\n- Deployment\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Subscribing to events/changes on every component\n\nThe informer in MeshSync actively listens to changes in resources and updates them in real time based on the informer configuration in the CRD.\n\n## Subscription Status and Health\n\n### Flushing MeshSync\n\n### Sythentic Test of MeshSync\n\n_TODO: Include example of how to invoke this built-in check._\n\n# Scalability and Performance\n\nOne Meshery Operator and one MeshSync are deployed to each Kuberentes cluster under management.\n\n## Tiered Discovery\n\nKubernetes clusters may grow very large with thousands of objects on them. The process of positively identifying and classifying resources by type, aligning them with Meshery's object model can be intense. Discovery tiers (for speed and scalability of MeshSync) successively refine the process of infrastructure identification (see [Composite Prints](#composite-fingerprints)).\n\nFor efficient management of large Kubernetes clusters, MeshSync uses tiered discovery. This approach progressively refines the identification of relevant infrastructure, optimizing the speed and scalability of MeshSync. You have control over the depth of object discovery, enabling you to strike the right balance between granularity and performance for efficient cluster management.\n\n## Event-Driven Implementation\n\nMeshery's event-driven approach ensures high-speed operations, making it suitable for managing both small and large clusters. [Meshery Broker](./broker) uses NATS as the messaging bus to ensure continuous communication between MeshSync and Meshery Server. In case of connectivity interruptions, MeshSync data is persisted in NATS topics.\n\n# MeshSync FAQs\n\n## How to configure MeshSync's resource discovery behavior: Can specific, \"uninteresting\" resources be blacklisted?\n\nMeshSync is managed by [Meshery Operator]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/architecture/operator), which watches for changes on the `meshsync` CRD for changes and updates the deployed MeshSync instance accordingly. You can blacklist specific Kubernetes resources from being discovered and watched by MeshSync. In order to identify the list of one or more resources for MeshSync to ignore, update the `meshsync` CRD using kubectl:\n\n- Download the CRD with `kubectl get crd meshsyncs.meshery.layer5.io -o yaml > meshsync.yaml`\n- Open the downloaded file and edit the field `informer_config` to blacklist all the types of resources that you don't want updates from.\n- Apply the new definition with `kubectl apply -f meshsync.yaml`\n\n# Roadmap\n\n## Non-Kubernetes Deployments\n\nEven if you're not using Kubernetes, Meshery empowers you to manage your infrastructure efficiently, providing a unified solution for different deployment environments.\n\n# Recap\n\nMeshSync maintains an up-to-date snapshot of your cluster, ensuring you always have an accurate view of your infrastructure. This snapshot is refreshed in real-time through event-based updates. Whether you're starting fresh or adopting Meshery into existing setups, MeshSync supports both greenfield and brownfield discovery of your environment."

						"content": "Quick Start with {{ page.title }} \n\nMeshery can manage your minikube clusters and is particularly useful for multi-cluster management and deployments.\n\nFor Meshery to manage your Minikube cluster, it has to be discovered and added as a Kubernetes connection in the Meshery server.\n\nAfter your cluster has been added as a connection, you can use Meshery to make infrastructure deployments of your [Meshery Designs](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery?chapter=creating-designs) to your cluster. To learn more about this, See [Deploying Meshery Designs](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery?chapter=deploying-meshery-designs). You can also Visualize the resources in your cluster in Operator Mode, See [Views in Visualizer](https://docs.layer5.io/kanvas/visualizer/visualizer-views/).\n\n**There are two ways to create this connection:**\n\n1. Deploying Meshery in minikube [(in-cluster)](#in-cluster-installation).\n1. Deploying Meshery using Docker and connect it to minikube [(out-of-cluster)](#out-of-cluster-installation).\n\n**_Note: It is advisable to [Install Meshery in your Minikube clusters](#install-meshery-into-your-minikube-cluster)_**\n\nPrerequisites  \n  \n    Install the Meshery command-line client, mesheryctl.\n    Install kubectl on your local machine.\n    Install  Minikube on your local machine.\n    Install Helm.\n  \n\n\nAlso see: [Install Meshery on Kubernetes]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation/kubernetes)\n\n## Available Deployment Methods\n\n- [Preflight Checks](#preflight-checks)\n  - [Preflight: Cluster Connectivity](#1-preflight-cluster-connectivity)\n  - [Preflight: Meshery Authentication](#2-preflight-meshery-authentication)\n\n- [In-cluster Installation](#in-cluster-installation)\n  - [Installation: Install Meshery on Kubernetes Using `mesheryctl`](#installation-install-meshery-on-kubernetes-using-mesheryctl)\n  - [Installation: Using Helm](#installation-using-helm)\n\n- [Out-of-cluster Installation](#out-of-cluster-installation)\n  - [Installation: Install Meshery on Docker Using `mesheryctl`](#installation-install-meshery-on-docker)\n  - [Minikube Docker Driver Users](#minikube-docker-driver-users)\n\n- [Uploading Configuration File in the Meshery Web UI](#uploading-configuration-file-in-the-meshery-web-ui)\n- [Post-Installation Steps](#post-installation-steps)\n  \n## Preflight Checks\n\nBefore deploying Meshery on minikube, complete the following initial setup tasks to prepare your environment.\n\n### 1. Preflight: Cluster Connectivity\n\nStart minikube using the following command if it is not already running:\n{% capture code_content %}$ minikube start{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nCheck the status of your minikube cluster by running:\n{% capture code_content %}$ minikube status{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nVerify that the current context is set to minikube by running:\n{% capture code_content %}$ kubectl config current-context{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n### 2. Preflight: Meshery Authentication\n\nEnsure you are logged in and [authenticated with Meshery](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/mesheryctl/authenticate-with-meshery-via-cli) by running the following command:\n\n{% capture code_content %}$ mesheryctl system login{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n# In-cluster Installation\n\n## Installation: Install Meshery on Kubernetes Using `mesheryctl`\n\nTo install Meshery inside your minikube cluster, run the command:\n{% capture code_content %}$ mesheryctl system start -p kubernetes{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nThis command deploys the Meshery Helm chart in the Meshery namespace.\n\nTo verify your deployment, run:\n{% capture code_content %}$ helm list -A -n meshery{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nAfter deployment, access the Meshery UI using port forwarding, with the command:\n{% capture code_content %}$  mesheryctl system dashboard --port-forward {% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nFor detailed instructions on port forwarding, refer to the [port-forwarding]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/mesheryctl/system/dashboard) guide.\n\nBy default, Meshery auto-detects your Minikube cluster and establishes a connection. However, if this doesn’t happen, you can connect by running the following command:\n{% capture code_content %}$  mesheryctl system config minikube {% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\nThe `mesheryctl system config minikube` command properly configures and uploads your kubeconfig file to the Meshery UI.\n\n\n\n## Installation: Using Helm\n\nYou can deploy Meshery directly using the Helm CLI.\nFor detailed instructions on installing Meshery using Helm V3, please refer to the [Helm Installation](/installation/kubernetes/helm) guide.\n\n# Out-of-cluster Installation\n\nTo install Meshery on Docker(out-of-cluster) and connect it to your Minikube cluster, follow these steps:\n\n## Installation: Install Meshery on Docker\n\nRun the following command to start Meshery in a Docker environment:\n{% capture code_content %}$ mesheryctl system start -p docker{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nThis will spin up meshery docker containers. To verify that Meshery  is running, use\n{% capture code_content %}$ docker ps{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nMeshery UI will be accessible on your local machine on port 9081. Open your browser and access Meshery at http://localhost:9081.\n\nConfigure Meshery to connect with your minikube cluster by running the command:\n{% capture code_content %}$ mesheryctl system config minikube {% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n### Minikube Docker Driver Users\n\nFor users running minikube with the Docker driver, specific steps are needed to ensure that Meshery can connect properly to your minikube cluster.\n\nIf you set up your minikube cluster using the [Docker driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/), both minikube and Meshery will be running in Docker containers. So, you need to ensure that the Meshery and minikube containers can communicate with each other by placing them in the same Docker network.\n\nTo configure this, run the following commands:\n\n\n $ docker network connect bridge meshery-meshery-1\n\n\n\n\n\n $ docker network connect minikube meshery-meshery-1\n\n\nNext, update the Kubernetes API server address in your kubeconfig file before running the `mesheryctl system config minikube` command. The steps to do this are outlined below.\n\n#### Next Step: Update the Kubernetes API Server Address for Meshery Access\n\nTo allow the Meshery container to access your Minikube cluster (since both are running in containers), you need to update the Kubernetes API server address in your `kubeconfig file` to the `external minikube IP address`. This is necessary because Docker typically forwards ports to a localhost address, which isn’t accessible between containers.\n\nTo retrieve the Minikube IP, run the command `minikube ip`. To check which port minikube is using, run `docker ps` to view the container's port, which is typically `8443`.\n\nOpen the kubeconfig file and update the server address.\n\n{% capture code_content %}$ nano ~/.kube/config.yaml\n\n## Change the server address\n\nserver: https://{minikubeIP}:{port}\n\n{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n`Ctrl + X` then enter `Y` to save and close the file.\n\nNext run this command to configure Meshery to access your cluster.\n{% capture code_content %}$  mesheryctl system config minikube{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n**Note**: An alternative to running the mesheryctl system config minikube command for meshery to discover your cluster is manually uploading your config file to the UI.\n\n# Uploading Configuration File in the Meshery Web UI\n\n**Note**: Meshery can only connect to your cluster if it is running locally (Kubernetes or Docker). Direct connections are not possible when using the hosted [Meshery Playground](https://playground.meshery.io/).\n\n**To manually upload your kubeconfig file after running Meshery locally**:\n\n1. In the Meshery UI, navigate to **Lifecycle** from the menu on the left.\n2. Click on **Connections**.\n3. Click on **Add Cluster** and search for your kubeconfig file.\n4. Click **Import**.\n\n**Note**:  If you encounter a connections refused error while uploading your kubeconfig, try changing your cluster server URL to the external API address of minikube. To do this follow the steps listed in the [Minikube Docker Driver Users Section](#docker-driver-update-the-kubernetes-api-server-address-for-meshery-access).\n\n#### Troubleshooting Meshery Installation\n\nIf you experience any issues during installation, refer to the [Troubleshooting Meshery Installations](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/troubleshooting/installation#setting-up-meshery-using-kind-or-minikube) guide for help.\n\n# Post-Installation Steps\n\nVerify the health of your Meshery deployment, using mesheryctl system check.\n\n{% include_cached installation/accessing-meshery-ui.md %}\n\n{% include related-discussions.html tag=\"meshery\" %}"

						"content": "Models are units of packaging for Meshery's logical object representation. Models (packages) are versioned and bundle any number of components, relationships, policies, connections and credentials. Meshery's internal object model is designed to provide a consistent and extensible way of capturing and characterizing the resources (applications, services, and infrastructure) under Meshery's management. Models serve as an exportable package (OCI-compatible image) to define managed infrastructure, their relationships, and details specifics of how they are to be managed.\n\n## Key aspects of Meshery Models\n\n* **Logical Representation:** Models offer a logical representation of entities under Meshery's management, abstracting away system-specific details.\n* **Packaging:** Model packages can be imported and exported as OCI-compatible images, ensuring portability and encapsulation of intellectual property.\n* **Components:** Components within a Model represent the capabilities of the underlying platform and are used by operators to build applications.\n* **Relationships:** Relationships define interactions and dependencies between components within a model.\n* **Policies:** Policies govern the behavior and constraints of components and relationships, ensuring adherence to desired operational practices.\n* **Extensibility:** Models are highly extensible, allowing you to define custom components, relationships, and policies. \n\n{% include alert.html title=\"Creating your own models\" type=\"light\" content=\"If you would like to create your own, augment existing models, or contribute new models, please refer to the Contributing to Models guide.\" %}\n\n\nSee [Contributing to Models](/project/contributing/contributing-models).\n\nAs a cloud native manager that provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing multi-cloud and cloud native applications and infrastructure, Meshery needs object models that can granularly characterize a wide range of systems under management from simple applications to complex microservices architectures and their infrastructure. This document describes the Meshery Model and its constituent set of entities  used to represent and manage cloud and cloud native systems.\n\nUsing Meshery Models, users can define and manage cloud-native systems, including applications, services, and infrastructure. Models provide a way to represent the desired state of the system, and they can be used to deploy, monitor, and manage cloud-native applications. Models are designed to be extensible, allowing users to define new constructs as needed. They are also machine-readable, allowing them to be used by automation tools.\n\n### Model Portability and Your Intellectual Property\n\nEach model (package) can be imported and exported from Meshery Server as OCI-compatible images. This makes models portable, abstracts their complexity, and encapsulates intellectual property that you might have created while designing your own models. Model packages are versioned and bundle any number of components, relationships, policies, connections, and credentials.\n\nEvery entity type is implemented by a [registrant]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/registry). Without registrants and models, Meshery can't manage any kind of infrastructure.\n\nMost registrants configure a specific infrastructure platform (either cloud or self-hosted). Registrants vary in their capabilities. Capabilities come in the form of components, some of which represent infrastructure to be managed others of which represent functional additional functionality to augment Meshery's behavior and deepen its feature set. Some registrants offer infrastructure-specific orchestration. For example the Meshery Adapter for Istio offers integration with each of Istio's addons. Others registrants offer specific services. For example, the Meshery Adapter for Nighthawk offers load generation and service performance characteriazation.\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMeshery Models adhere to several design principles, including establishing a set of constructs, clearly defining construct boundaries, allowing construct extension, reusing existing models, being user-centric, and simplifying complex networking and distributed systems. Meshery Models is designed to meet the following goals:\n\n* **Comprehensive:** The model should be able to represent a wide range of cloud and cloud native resources.\n* **Extensible:** The model should be extensible, allowing new constructs to be added as needed.\n* **User-centric:** The model should be easy for users to understand and use.\n* **Machine-readable:** The model should be machine-readable, allowing it to be used by automation tools.\n\n## Models as the Unit of Packaging\n\nEach model package can be imported and exported from the system as OCI-compatible images, making them portable (a design goal), abstracting their complexity, and encapsulating potential intellectual property that users might have invested into their models. Model packages are versioned and bundle any number of components, relationships, policies, connections and credentials. For example:\n\n{% include alert.html title=\"Model Packaging\" type=\"info\" content=\"Model constructs can be packaged and exported as OCI-compatible images. This makes them portable and allows them to be shared between different environments.\" %}\n\n![Meshery Models]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/concepts/meshery-models.png)\n_Figure: Model Construct Classification_\n\n## Key aspects and characteristics\n\nYou might not fully comprehend the Meshery Models figure above. The following analogy offers an alternative viewpoint from which to comprehend the Capabilities Registry (where Models are imported and their capabilities registered for use).  \n\n![Meshery Models Analogy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/concepts/meshery-models-analogy.svg)\n_Figure: Registrar's Office and Meshery Models Analogy_\n\n### Models\n\nModels introduce various core constructs that form the foundation of the model. Some of the core constructs mentioned in the document include Components, Designs, Policies, and Relationships. Models having the same `name` and `version` attributes are considered duplicates.\n\n### Component\n\n[Component]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/components) represent entities in the Meshery ecosystem, exposing capabilities of the underlying platform. They can be registered, created, and used by users and operators. Components have definitions, instances, and associated metadata. Components having the same `kind`, `apiVersion` and `model.name` attributes are considered duplicates.\n\n### Policy\n\n[Policies]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/policies) includes constructs for managing metrics, defining actions, and specifying color properties of components or designs. These constructs help in monitoring, controlling, and visualizing different aspects of the Meshery ecosystem.\n\n### Relationships\n\n[Relationships]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/relationships) define the nature of interaction between interconnected components in Model. They represent various types of connections and dependencies between components, such as hierarchical, network, or default relationships. Relationships have selectors, metadata, and optional parameters.\n\n#### Evaluation of Relationships\n\nMeshery provides a relationship evaluation algorithm to ensure desired behavior enforcement. [Policies](policies) can be applied to components and relationships, defining rules and actions based on predefined conditions.\n\n{% include alert.html title=\"Model Schema\" type=\"info\" content=\"Model constructs are defined using a schema language called Cue. Cue is a powerful and expressive language that is well-suited for defining cloud-native constructs.\" %}\n\n### Designs\n\n[Designs]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/designs) are deployable units in Meshery that describe the desired infrastructure. They consist of components and patterns, allowing users to define and configure the behavior of their cloud-native applications. A design is a collection of components and patterns that represent a desired state of infrastructure. Designs are used to deploy and manage cloud-native systems.\n\n### Patterns\n\n[Patterns](patterns) are reusable configuration that can be applied to components or designs. They define best practices for configuring and operating cloud-native application functionality. Patterns can be applied to components or designs, and they are read-only.\n\n{% include alert.html title=\"Metadata\" type=\"info\" content=\"Metadata provide additional details about a component in Meshery. They offer specific functionality or characteristics associated with a component, enhancing its capabilities. Metadata can be attached to components to customize their behavior.\" %}\n\n## Versioning\n\n![Versioning Models](/assets/img/concepts/logical/versioning-meshery-entities.svg)\n\n\n## Summary\n\nA Model serves as a unit of packaging for Meshery's logical object representation. Models encompass a structured framework that defines the components, relationships, policies, and other elements that constitute a system or application under Meshery's management. Models offer a way to encapsulate the complexities of diverse systems and provide a standardized representation for management and interaction."

To modify the default configuration, find `~/.meshery/meshery.yaml` on your system. `~/.meshery/meshery.yaml` is a Docker Compose file.\n\n#### Configuration: Running fewer Meshery adapters\n\nTo customize which Meshery Adapters are used in which deployments, customize your contexts in your meshconfig.\n\n*Recommended:*\nConfigure your meshconfig, using `mesheryctl system context` to customize which Meshery Adapters are used in which deployments.\n\n*Alternative:*\nAlternatively, directly modify the `~/.meshery/meshery.yaml` configuration file, remove the entry(ies) of the adapter(s) you are removing from your deployment.\n\n#### Configuration: Running more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter\n\nThe default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the Meshery Adapter for NGINX Service Mesh. To do so, you can use either of Meshery's clients or to modify your Meshery deployment:\n - Using `mesheryctl`, modify `~/.meshery/meshery.yaml` to include multiple copies of the given adapter.\n - Using Meshery UI, navigate to the Settings page and enter the host and port of your additional adapter.\n\n#### Configuration: Choosing an adapter while installing Mesheryctl\n\nWhile installing mesheryctl using bash installation script, we can choose which adapter to be loaded.\nThis is done by passing ADAPTERS environment variable to meshery bash script.\n\n*For e.g.* \n`curl -L https://meshery.io/install | ADAPTERS=consul PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -` installs mesheryctl and starts Meshery Server in your connected Kubernetes cluster deploying only the Meshery Adapter for Consul and not the rest of Meshery's adapters.\n\nDemo of Meshery managing deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters:\n\n\n\nSee on YouTube: [Cloud Native Austin Virtual Meetup: April 2020](https://youtu.be/yWPu3vq4vEs?t=5041&list=PL3A-A6hPO2IOpTbdH89qR-4AE0ON13Zie)"

Meshery Server connections to Kubernetes clusters are controlled using Meshery Server clients: `mesheryctl` or Meshery UI.  This behavior described below is consistent whether your Meshery deployment is using Docker or Kubernetes as the platform to host the Meshery deployment.\n\n**Meshery CLI**\n`mesheryctl` initiates connection to Kubernetes cluster when `mesheryctl system start` is executed and disconnects when `mesheryctl system stop` is executed. This behavior is consistent whether your Meshery deployment is using Docker or Kubernetes as the platform to host the Meshery deployment.\n\n**Meshery UI**\nMeshery UI offers more granular control over the deployment of Meshery Operator in that you can remove Meshery Operator from a Kubernetes cluster without disconnecting Meshery Server from the Kubernetes cluster. You can control the deployment of Meshery Operator using the on/off switch found in the Meshery Operator section of  Settings.\n\n### Does the Meshery Operator use an SDK or framework? \nYes, Meshery Operator used the Operator SDK."

Patterns will be importable and exportable as OCI images in v0.8.0.' %}\n\nPatterns are essentially atomic designs with one or more components made in composed into an atomic, reusable design. Patterns are a way to apply the DRY principle when managing the configuration of cloud native infrastructure.  \n\n## Use Meshery to Deploy a Cloud Native Pattern\n\nUse Meshery to deploy a cloud native pattern. Cloud native patterns are detailed as a YAML file. See the [Configuration Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/configuration-management) guide.\n\n### Pattern Repository\n\n_See [Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog)_.\n\nYou may bring your own patterns or find them available through your chosen provider. Each cloud native pattern carries a unique identifier for reference. The patterns in this repository serve in an educational capacity, facilitating learning, and also serve in an operational capacity, facilitating implementation and validation of your cloud native deployment’s adherence to a pattern.\n\n{% include alert.html\n    type=\"info\"\n    title=\"Repository of Cloud Native Patterns\"\n    content=\"A central set of design patterns is available in Meshery Catalog (concept, site).\" %}\n\n\n## Importing Patterns\n\nYou can import a pattern using `mesheryctl` or Meshery UI. Patterns can be imported from your local filesystem, an HTTP/S endpoint, or from GitHub. When provided a GitHub location (org/repo), Meshery will recursively search the given directory (or the entire repository) for existing pattern files.\n\n### Using Meshery CLI\n\n#### To import a pattern, execute this command:\n\n```\n$ mesheryctl design import -f \nImporting pattern…\nPattern imported.\n```\n\n### Using Meshery UI:\n\nFrom Meshery UI, patterns can be imported from your local filesystem or imported from a remote URL.\n\n\n    \n\n\n_To upload from url click the link icon_\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n#### To deploy a pattern, execute this command:\n\n```\n$ mesheryctl design apply -f \nDeploying pattern…\nPattern successfully applied.\n```\n\nFrom here, output and behavior will vary based upon the specific pattern you’re deploying. Should you find that your pattern is not successfully deployed, refer to the pattern troubleshooting guide in the Meshery documentation.\n\nAs you step through each pattern, you might choose to modify the pattern to suit your specific environment and workload, exploring in-context of your specific situation. Optionally, you may choose to use a plugin like Kanvas, or another visual cloud native topology tool, to facilitate your comprehension of the patterns and to literally see the patterns in-action.\n\nTake time to explore. Try deploying one cloud native’s sample application onto a different cloud native and compare differences in behavior and each cloud native’s ability to manage it. If using Meshery to do so, execute the following commands as an example to deploy the sample application, BookCatalog, onto Open cloud native:\n\n```\n$ mesheryctl design apply -f book-catalog\nDeploying application “BookCatalog”...\nDeployed. Endpoint(s) available at: http://localhost:8000/catalog\n```\n\n## Related Reading\n\n- [`mesheryctl design`]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/mesheryctl/pattern)"

						"content": "This guide walks through running performance benchmarks using Meshery. Users can either use the Meshery UI, the CLI, mesheryctl or run performance tests in their CI/CD pipelines using the Meshery GitHub Action.\n\n## Installing Meshery\n\nInstall and login to Meshery to start running performance benchmarks. See [Installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation) documentation for detailed steps on how to install Meshery.\n\n_Meshery dashboard_\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to run performance benchmarks on a service mesh, you can use Meshery's service mesh lifecycle management capabilities to deploy a service mesh and deploy your application on the mesh. \n\nWith Meshery's performance benchmarking feature, you can also deploy you application off the mesh and compare the performance and determine the overhead when the app runs on the mesh.\n\nTo install a service mesh, see [this guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/service-meshes).\n\nMeshery also comes with a set of [sample applications](h{{ site.baseurl }}/guides/sample-apps) that you can quickly deploy to test out the capabilities of your service mesh.\n\nNext, we navigate to the main Performance Testing dashboard. See [Performance Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/tasks/performance/managing-performance) to learn more about performance profiles, load generators, Kubernetes cluster, and service mesh metrics.\n\n## Running Performance Benchmarks Through Meshery UI\n\nMeshery UI provides an easy-to-use interface in which users can create performance profiles to run repeated tests with similar configuration and can also even schedule performance tests to be run at particular times through the calendar.\n\nOn the navigation menu, click on performance.\n\nThis will open the performance management dashboard as shown below. \n\n\n\n_Performance Management Dashboard_\n\nTo create a performance profile, click on \"Manage Profiles\" and then select \"+ Add Performance Profile\".\n\n\n\n_Performance Profiles_\n\nThis will open up a popup window where you can fill out the test configuration for running your benchmarks.\n\n\n\n_Configuring a Performance Test_\n\nYou can now save the profile and run the test. The test will continue to run in the background even if you close the popup.\n\n\n\nOnce the test is done, you would be able to see the results of the test below.\n\n\n\n_Performance Test Results_\n\nYou can then go back to your performance profile and get these results anytime.\n\nYou can also compare different test results in Meshery and draw insights. For example, you can run this test with your application running on different service meshes and check which performs better.\n\n\n\n_Selecting multiple test results_\n\n\n\n_Comparing multiple test results_\n\n## Running Performance Benchmarks Through mesheryctl\n\nThe `mesheryctl perf` subcommand provides the performance management features of Meshery in the CLI.\n\nTo run a performance test based on a performance profile, run:\n\n```\nmesheryctl perf apply Istio Performance Test\n```\n\nYou can also use flags to configure your performance test. For example:\n\n```\nmesheryctl perf apply istio-soak-test --concurrent-requests 1 --duration 15s --load-generator nighthawk --mesh istio --url http://localhost:2323\n```\n\nmesheryctl also supports test configurations written in SMP compatible format as shown below:\n\n```\ntest:\n  smp_version: v0.0.1\n  name: Istio Performance Test\n  labels: {}\n  clients:\n    - internal: false\n      load_generator: fortio\n      protocol: 1\n      connections: 2\n      rps: 10\n      headers: {}\n      cookies: {}\n      body: ''\n      content_type: ''\n      endpoint_urls:\n        - 'http://localhost:2323/productpage'\n  duration: '30m'\nmesh:\n  type: 3\n```\n\nAnd then you can pass this file to mesheryctl as:\n\n```\nmesheryctl perf apply -f perf-config.yaml\n```\n\nYou can also override the configuration passed in the file with flags like shown below:\n\n```\nmesheryctl perf apply -f perf-config.yaml --url http://localhost:2323/productpage?u=test --load-generator nighthawk --qps 5\n```\n\n## Running Performance Benchmarks in your Pipelines\n\nMeshery also has a [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action) which is a GitHub action that can be used to run performance tests in your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nDownload the token from the Meshery Dashboard by clicking on the profile icon on the top-right corner.\n\n_Downloading the token_\n\n\n\nYou can use this token to authenticate the instance of Meshery running in your CI/CD workflow.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Using the token in GitHub workflows\" content=\"You can use the secrets feature in GitHub to store the token.\" %}\n\nThe action can be used by defining your test configuration in a performance profile in Meshery or by writing your test configuration in [SMP compatible format](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action#smp-compatible-test-configuration-file).\n\nThe action can then be configured as shown below:\n\n```\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n```\n\nMore configuration details of the action can be found [here](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/blob/master/action.yml).\n\nSee [sample configurations](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action#sample-configuration) for more workflow examples using this action."

Meshery Playground provides a sandboxed environment to experiment with different infrastructure configurations and deployment options. Its multi-player plugins allow you to collaborate in real-time with your teammates on infrastructure design and operation.\n\nWith Meshery Playground, you can:\n\n\n  Collaborate with other engineers, share your knowledge, and exchange ideas\n  Explore new cloud native tools without the need for complex setup or configuration. Simply open your browser and go.\n  Design new cloud native scenarios and easily deploy them in the Playground environment. Keep your designs and deploy them in your own environment when you’re ready.\n\n\nYou can interactively explore any service mesh like Istio, Linkerd, Consul, Kuma, and so on without having to install them on your local machine. You can create virtual services and deploy sample applications using these meshes and observe their behavior in real-time.\n\nMeshery Playground also has pre-built scenarios that demonstrate how to implement specific use-cases such as traffic splitting, circuit breaking, and other cloud native patterns.\n\nMeshery Playground FAQ\nQuestion: Why do I need to sign-up/register to use the Cloud Native Playground?\nAnswer: The Playground is connected to live Kubernetes clusters, and while these clusters are refreshed on a daily basis, the clusters do need to be protected from nefarious actors, who might use these clusters for cryptomining, for example.\n\nSign-up to receive a user account, entitled with perpetually free and full access the Playground environment.\n\nThe Meshery Playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full-control over those clusters. Requiring users to register a user account keeps the Playground safe and healthy for all to enjoy. Without requiring users to sign-in, the Meshery Playground would allow anonymous access for anyone and everyone to potentially perform nefarious acts.\n\nQuestion: Will I lose my Meshery designs in the Cloud Native Playground?\nAnswer: No, all of the designs that you have created in the Meshery Playground are saved to your user account and will be available to you each time you sign into your account. Your designs will be available in the Meshery Playground and any your other Meshery deployments, too.\n\nIn other words, all work done in Kanvas Designer is persisted to your user account.\n\nQuestion: Will I lose my Meshery deployments in the Cloud Native Playground?\nAnswer: Yes, the Meshery Playground clusters are reset on a daily basis. However, only deployments (not designs) that you may have created will be lost.\n\nIn other words, only Kanvas Visualizer is reset. All of your work in Meshery UI and Kanvas Designer will remain in your user account.\n\nQuestion: Is there a demo user account that everyone can use?\nAnswer: It is imperative that each user has their own account to ensure seamless real-time collaboration within the Playground. The use of individual accounts is critical to enable multiple people to access and utilize the powerful collaboration features.\n\nCreating your own account ensures that any designs you create or save will be stored and accessible across sessions, preventing any loss of work.\n\nTo ensure accountability in the Playground, it’s crucial to promote the use of individual named accounts. This helps prevent bad actors from hiding behind anonymous general-use accounts and maliciously abusing the Playground. Therefore, the use of named accounts is an essential step towards achieving this goal.\n\nQuestion: Can I deploy the Meshery on-premises?\nAnswer: Yes, Meshery can be deployed on-premises with a single command to download, install, and run your own instance of Meshery in your environment. See all supported platforms to deploy your own Meshery instance at https://docs.meshery.io/installation"

This provides security for the public-facing Meshery UI as the remote provider enforces identity with authentication and authorization. You should also use a remote provider when your use of Meshery is ongoing or used in a team environment (used by multiple people). This can be seen when using Meshery Playground, where a user is prompted to login through the _Layer5 Meshery Cloud_ remote provider. Visit [Meshery Playground](https://playground.meshery.io/) to experience this.\n\nA specific remote provider can be enforced in a Meshery instance by passing the name of the provider with the env variable `PROVIDER`.  \n\nName: **\"Meshery\"** (default)\n\n- Enforces user authentication.\n- Long-term term persistence of test results.\n- Save environment setup.\n- Retrieve performance test results.\n- Retrieve conformance test results.\n- Free to use.\n\n### Local Provider\n\nThe use of the Local Provider, **\"None\"**, puts Meshery into a single-user mode and does not require authentication. Use the Local provider when your use of Meshery is intended to be shortlived.\n\nName: **“None”**\n\n- No user authentication.\n- Container-local storage of test results. Ephemeral.\n- Environment setup not saved.\n- No performance test result history.\n- No conformance test result history.\n- Free to use.\n\n### Design Principles: Meshery Remote Provider Framework\n\nMeshery's Remote Provider extensibility framework is designed to enable the following functionalities:\n\n1. **Pluggable UI Functionality**\n   - Out-of-tree custom UI components with seamless user experience.\n   - A system of remote retrieval of extension packages (ReactJS components and Golang binaries).\n\n1. **Pluggable Backend Functionality**\n   - Remote Providers have any number of capabilities unbeknownst to Meshery.\n\n1. **Pluggable AuthZ**\n   - Design an extensible role based access control system such that Remote Providers can determine their own set of controls. Remote Providers to return JWTs with custom roles, permission keys and permission keychains.\n\n## Building a Provider\n\nMeshery interfaces with providers through a Go interface. The Provider implementations have to be placed in the code and compiled together today. A Provider instance will have to be injected into Meshery when the program starts.\n\nMeshery keeps the implementation of Remote Providers separate so that they are brought in through a separate process and injected into Meshery at runtime (OR) change the way the code works to make the Providers invoke Meshery.\n\n### Remote Provider Extension Points\n\nInterwoven into Meshery’s web-based user interface are a variety of extension points. Each extension point is carefully carved out to afford a seamless user experience. Each extension point is identified by a name and type. The following Meshery UI extension points are available:\n\n|**Name**   |**Type**   | **Description**  |\n|---|---|---|\n|navigator |Menu Items   |This is supposed to be a full page extension which will get a dedicated endpoint in the meshery UI. And will be listed in the meshery UI’s navigator/sidebar. Menu items may refer to full page extensions.   |\n|user_prefs   |Single Component   |This is supposed to be remote react components which will get placed in a pre-existing page and will not have a dedicated endpoint. As of now, the only place where this extension can be loaded is the “User Preference” section under meshery settings.   |\n|account   |Full Page   |Remote Reactjs components (or other) are placed in a pre-existing page and will have dedicated endpoint: `/extension/account`.   |\n|collaborator |Single Component|This is supposed to be remote react components which will get placed in a pre-existing page and will not have a dedicated endpoint. Currently, placed at the Header component of Mehery UI. Its work is to show active Meshery users under the same remote provider.|\n  |/extension/\\|Full Page|The Provider package is unzipped into Meshery server filesystem under `/app/provider-pkg/`.|\n\nRemote Providers must fulfill the following endpoints:\n\n1. `/login` - return valid token\n1. `/logout` - invalidating token\n1. `/capabilities` - return capabilities.json\n\n## UI Extension Points\n\nAll UI extensions will be hosted under the endpoint ``.\n\n### UserPrefs\n\nThe UserPrefs extension point expects and loads a component to be displayed into `/userpreferences` page.\n\n### Navigator\n\nThe Navigator extension point loads a set of menu items to be displayed in the menu bar on the left hand side of the Meshery UI.\n\n## Capabilities Endpoint Example\n\nMeshery Server will proxy all requests to remote provider endpoints. Endpoints are dynamically determined and identified in the _**capabilities**_ section of the `/capabilities` endpoint. Providers as an object have the following attributes (this must be returned as a response to `/capabilities` endpoint):\n\nCapabilities Endpoint Example\n{% capture code_content %}{\n

Registration\n\nEvery Meshery server is capable of registering itself with the remote provider, considering that remote provider supports this feature as a capability.\nOn successful authentication with the remote provider, Meshery server registers itself by sending a POST request to the remote provider through the `persist-connection` capability. The body of the request should include information so as to uniquely indentify Meshery server and its status.\n\nExample of the request body:\n\n{% capture code_content %}\n  {\n    \"server_id\": \"xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx\",\n    \"server_version\": \"vx.x.x\",\n    \"server_build-sha\": \"xxxx-xxxxx\",\n    \"server_location\": \"://:”\n  }\n{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n## Configurable OAuth Callback URL\n\nAs of the release `v0.5.39`, Meshery Server has extended its capability to configure the callback URL for connected _Remote Providers_. This is helpful when you are deploying Meshery behind an ingress gateway or reverse proxy. You can specify a custom, redirect endpoint for the connected Remote Provider.\nLet's understand this through an example deployment scenario below.\n\n### Example Deployment Scenario: Meshery Cloud, Istio, and Azure Kubernetes Service\n\nUser has deployed the Meshery behind a Istio Ingress Gateway and the Istio is also behind an Application Gateway (e.g. AKS Application Gateway). Generally, when you use a GitHub Remote Provider for authentication, it redirect the request to the Istio Ingress Gateway FQDN. In this setup, redirection won't be successful because the Ingress Gateway is behind an additional Application Gateway. In this case, you have to define where the request should be redirected once it is authenticated from GitHub.\n\n**_SOLUTION_**\n\nYou can define a custom callback URL by setting up the `MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable while installing Meshery.\n\n**Example using Helm**\n\nFirst, construct the URL in the format\n```https://[CUSTOM_URL]/api/user/token```\n\n- Where `[CUSTOM_URL]` is the URL where **Meshery server** will be or is installed. For example, `https://k8s-staging.test.io/`.\n- And `api/user/token` is the **Auth Endpoint** and is append at the end of your custom URL.\n\nSo, the final URL would look similar to\n```https://k8s-staging.test.io/api/user/token```\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Note\" content=\"Callback URL is not the same as Provider URL. In scenarios where Meshery server and Provider is installed on same server, pay attention to paths or subdomains.\" %}\n\nNext, set the `MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL` variable when running the `helm install`. Below is an example:\n\n{% capture code_content %}helm install meshery meshery/meshery --namespace meshery --set env.MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL=\n{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIf Meshery server is accessible in a path of the URL such as `https://k8s-staging.test.io/meshery`, then the callback URL will be `https://k8s-staging.test.io/meshery/api/user/token`.\n\n## Managing your Remote Provider Extension Code\n\nRemote Provider extensions are kept out-of-tree from Meshery (server and UI). You might need to build your extensions under the same environment and set of dependencies as Meshery. The Meshery framework of extensibility has been designed such that in-tree extensions can be safely avoided while still providing a robust platform from which to extend Meshery’s functionality. Often, herein lies the delineation of open vs. closed functionality within Meshery. Remote Providers can bring (plugin) what functionality that they want behind this extensible interface (more about Meshery extensibility), at least that is up to the point that Meshery has provided a way to plug that feature in.\n\nOffering out-of-tree support for Meshery extensions means that:\n\n1. source code to your Meshery extensions are not required to be open source,\n1. liability to Meshery’s stability is significantly reduced, avoiding potential bugs in extended components.\n\nThrough clearly defined extension points, Meshery extensions may be offered as closed source capabilities that plug into open source Meshery code. To facilitate integration of your Meshery extensions, you might automate the building and releasing of your separate, but interdependent code repositories. You will be responsible for sustaining both your ReactJS and Golang-based extensions."

						"content": "# Meshery Registry: A Central Hub for Capabilities\n\nThe Meshery Registry is a vital component within Meshery, serving as a centralized repository for managing a diverse range of cloud and cloud native resources. It stores and organizes crucial information such as models, categories, components, and relationships, enabling efficient interaction and utilization of these resources within the Meshery ecosystem. You can conveniently [access and manage registry data](#interacting-with-the-meshery-registry) through Meshery UI, and through Meshery CLI ([mesheryctl registry]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/mesheryctl/#meshery-registry-management)).\n\nAs the central repository for all capabilities known to Meshery, contains various entities.\n\n\n  Contents of the Registry\n  \n  Models: Blueprints defining configurations for interacting with cloud-native infrastructure. They consist of operations, components, relationships, and policies.\n  \n    Components: Reusable building blocks for depicting capabilities defined within models.\n    Relationships: Define the nature of connections between components within a model, describing how they interact and depend on each other.\n    Policies: Enforce specific rules and governance for system behavior under Meshery's management.\n    Connections: Managed and unmanaged resources that Meshery can interact with.\n    Credentials: Optionally, included secrets associated with connections contained in a model.\n  \n  \n\n\n## Key Concepts and Terminology\n\n- **Registry**: a component within Meshery that contains a database of known capabilities.\n- **Registrar**: The internal Meshery Server process responsible for managing and maintaining the registry.\n- **Registrant** (Entity Source): The source of an entity (e.g., model file, Kubernetes cluster).\nEntity (Registree): An individual capability stored in the registry (e.g., model, component).\n- **Registrant** *(Host)*: A Meshery Connection responsible for sourcing and registering entities. A registrant can perform registration for their own entities, or a registrant can act as a proxy on behalf of a third-party entity source.\n- **Entity** *(registree)* - an entry in the Meshery Registry; e.g. a model, component, relationship, or policy. Sometimes referred to as a capability.\n\n\n## Models in the Registry\n\nYou will find two types of models in the registry: Static and Dynamic.\n\n- **Static Models:** Pre-defined models included with each Meshery release. See the full list of static models.\n- **Dynamic Models:** Generated at run-time by connecting Meshery to supported platforms like Kubernetes clusters or cloud providers.\n\nEach Meshery release comes with a built-in set of models automatically registered at Meshery Server boot-time. These built-in models offer a core set of entities for Meshery's supported [integrations](/extensibility/integrations). Once Meshery Server is running, and as it connects to and discovers your infrastructure, *dynamic models* are automatically generated. A given Meshery release may not include all possible models found in your environment, so Meshery automatically generates *and registers* new models and components based on the specific infrastructure Meshery is connected to. Dyanmic models often lack additional metadata, such as descriptions, tags, and relationships, which are typically included in static models.\n\n## Interacting with the Meshery Registry\n\nUse either Meshery UI or CLI to interact with the Registry. Meshery UI offers a user-friendly visual interface for browsing, searching, and managing registry entries. You can easily explore available models, components, and relationships, gaining insights into their properties and connections. Meshery CLI offers commands so that you can register, list, retrieve, update, and delete models, components, and relationships directly from the command line.\n\n### Model Generation\n\nThe process of generating a Model (and its entities) is a multi-step process and does not require use of Meshery Server. The process begins with the sourcing of the model information from an authoritative source: a Registrant. Registrants are responsible for providing all the necessary information to Meshery to generate the model.\n\n#### Using Meshery CLI to Generate Models\n\nMeshery CLI supports the generation of models from a Google Spreadsheet. The Google Spreadsheet should contain a list of model names and source locations from any supported Registrant (e.g. GitHub, Artifact Hub) repositories. The source locations can be a URL to a folder containing Kubernetes CRDs, or to a Helm Chart tar.gz, or an individual Kubernetes Manifest with custom resource definition.\n\nSee [`mesheryctl registry generate`](/reference/mesheryctl/registry/generate) for more information.\n\n### Model Registration\n\nOnce registered in the Meshery Registry, Models and their entities are available for use within that specific Meshery Server.\n\nMeshery [Adapters]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/architecture/adapters) are one example of a Registrant. Registrants are responsible for the registration of entities in the Meshery Registry. Adapters are responsible for the sourcing and registration of entities and the packaging of these enties into one or more models.\n\n#### Using Meshery CLI to Register a Model\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl model import -f \n```\n\n#### Using Meshery UI to Register a Model\n\nVisit the Settings --> Registry page and click the \"Import\" button to import a model.\n\n### Ignoring an Entity\n\nYou have control over whether a registered entity (model and all that the model contains) this can be an individual or team-level preference. Use the \"Ignore\" action to designate whether a given model is allowed to be used within a given Meshery Server deployment. Models that are ignored remain in the Meshery Registry but are not available for use within a given Meshery Server deployment."

						"content": "Meshery Relationships characterize how [components](./components) are connected and interact with each other. Relationships are defined within [models](./models) to aid in structuring the interrelationships between one or more components in a [design](./design) to further in comprehending the overall structure and dependencies within managed systems.\n\nMeshery recognizes that relationships exist in various forms and that the existence of a relationship might be interdependent upon the existence (or absence) of another relationship. To support this complexity, Meshery relationships are highly expressive, characterizing the nature of interaction of interconnected components no matter their genealogy.\n\n**Benefits of Using Meshery Relationships**\n\n- **Improved Visibility:** Relationships provide a clear visual representation of the connections between components, making it easier to understand the system's architecture.\n- **Enhanced Design:** Relationships help you make informed decisions about component selection and placement, leading to better design choices.\n- **Automated Configuration:** Relationship-driven actions can automate the configuration of components, reducing manual effort and potential errors.\n- **Increased Flexibility:** The use of selectors, actions, and operators provides flexibility in defining and managing relationships.\n\n{% include/alert.html type=\"dark\" title=\"Contributor Guide to Meshery Relationships\" content=\"If you want to create a new relationship definition or modify existing relationship definitions, see the Contributing to Meshery Relationships guide.\" %}\n\n## Types of Relationships\n\nMeshery supports different types of relationships to cater to various use cases:\n\n- **Hierarchical Relationships:** These represent parent-child relationships between components, where one component is a dependency of another. arent-child relationships show clear lineage, similar to a family tree (child, parent, grandparent, etc.).\n- **Sibling Relationships:** These represent relationships between components that are not directly dependent on each other but may still interact or influence each other's behavior; they describe components that share a common origin but operate independently (siblings, cousins, etc.).\n- **Edge Relationships:** These represent relationships that are visually depicted as edges connecting components in MeshMap. Edge relationships are used to define how components interact with each other, such as network connections, bindings, or permissions. They are also used to identify interdependencies between components.\n- **TagSets Relationships:** These represent relationships between components of same Labels or Annotations key/value pairs. Labels and Annotations are two different types of Tags. Labels are often used to identify components and are visible on the design canvas. Annotations are often used to provide additional information about components.\n \nRelationships are are categorized into different kinds, types, and subtypes, so that can be expressive of the specific manner in which one or more components relate to one another. Each type of relationship can be interpretted by Meshery UI (or other [extensions](/extensibility/extensions)) and mapped to a specific visual paradigm for the given kind relationship. Let's look at some examples of these visual paradigms; let's explore examples of way in which relationships are represented in Meshery.\n\n\n\n\n{% include relationships.html %}\n\n## The Meaning of Relationships\n\nMeshery supports a variety of relationships between components. These relationships are categorized into two types: Semantic and Non-Semantic. Relationships are categorized by whether they are meaningful in terms of how Meshery manages entities - a Semantic relationship - or are simply annotations to aid in the comprehension of you as the designer of the relationship - a Non-Semantic relationship.\n\n### Semantic Relationships\n\nSemantic relationships are those that are meaningful in the context of the application or infrastructure. For example, a `Service` in Kubernetes is semantically related to a `Deployment` or a `Pod`. These relationships are meaningful and are managed by Meshery.\n\n### Non-Semantic Relationships\n\nNon-semantic relationships are those that are meaningful to you as a user and your mental representation of your infrastructure and applications, but are not meaningful in terms of how Meshery evaluates the design or manages these relationships and their associated components. Non-sematic relationships are ignored by Meshery's lifecycle management engine. For example, a `Rectangle` shape that encloses other components (has a parent relationship with other child components) is not semantically meaningful to the way in which Meshery manages these resources. While the `Rectangle` shape might have a parent-child relationship with any number of Meshery-managed components, such a relationship does not implicate any management that Meshery might perform; they are not managed by Meshery.\n\n\n\n#### Identifiying Non-Semantic Relationships\n\nThe `isAnnotation` attribute of a Relationship or Component determines whether the given Relationship or Component represents a management concern for Meshery; whether the given Relationship or Component is sematically meaningful, and whose lifecycle is managed by Meshery.\n\n## Core Concepts of Relationships\n\n- Kinds\n- Types\n- Subtypes\n- Selectors\n- Selectors Sets\n\n## Kind, Type, and Subtype of Relationships\n\nThe combination of `kind`, `type`, and `subType` uniquely determines the visual paradigm for a given relationship; i.e., relationships with the same `kind`, `type`, and `subType` will share an identical visual representation regardless of the specific components involved in the relationship.\n\n### 1. Edge - Network\n\nThis Relationship type configures the networking between one or more components.\n\n**Examples**: An edge-network relationship between a Service and a Deployment or an edge-binding relationship between an Ingress and a Service.\n\n- Example 1) Service --> Deployment\n- Example 3) IngressController --> Ingress --> Service\n\nVisual Representation of Edge-Network Relationships\n           \n           1. Edge - Network: Ingress to Service (open in playground)\n           \n           \n           2. Edge - Network: Service to Pod (open in playground)\n           \n           \n           3.

Edge - Network: Service to Deployment (open in playground)\n           \n           \n   \n\n### 2. Edge - Mount\n\n**Example**: Assignment of PersistentVolumes to Pods via PersistenVolumeClaim.\n\n- Example 1) Pod --> PersistenVolumeClaim --> PersistentVolume\n\nVisual Representation of Edge-Mount Relationship\n           \n           Edge - Mount: Pod and Persistent volume via Persistent volume claim (open in playground) \n           \n           \n           \n   \n\n### 3. Edge - Permission\n\n**Example**: The set of Service Accounts that are entitled with the one or more Roles/ClusterRoles bound via Role/ClusterRoleBinding.\n\n- Example 1) ClusterRole --> CluserRoleBinding --> ServiceAccount\n- Example 2) Role --> RoleBinding --> ServiceAccount\n\nVisual Representation of Edge-Permission Relationship\n           \n           1. Edge - Permission: Cluster Role to Service Account  (open in playground)\n           \n\n\n\n\n### 4. Edge - Firewall\n\nKubernetes Network Policy for controlling ingress and egress traffic from Pod-to-Pod\n\n- Example 1) Pod --> NetworkPolicy --> Pod\n\nVisual Representation of Edge-Firewall Relationship\n           \n           Edge - Firewall: Pod to Pod (open in playground)\n           \n           \n   \n\n### 5. Hierarchical - Parent - Wallet\n\n**Example**\n\n- Example 1) (binary and configuration) --> IstioWASMPlugin\n- Example 2) WASMFilter (binary and configuration) --> IstioEnvoyFilter\n\nVisual Representation of Hierarchical-Inventory Relationship\n           1. Hierarchical - Inventory: Namespace and ConfigMap (open in playground)\n           \n\n\n\n\n### 6. Hierarchical - Parent - Inventory\n\n**Example**:\n\n- Example 1) Any namespaced Kubernetes component --> Kubernetes Namespace\n\nVisual Representation of Hierarchical-Parent Relationship\n           1. Hierarchical - Parent: Namespace (Parent) and ConfigMap (child), Role (Child)  (open in playground)\n           \n\n\n\n\n### 7. Match - Labels (Tagsets)\n\nThis relationship type defines the associations between components based on shared Labels or Annotations.\n\n**Example**: An label-based tag-set relationship between a NodePort service and an application. \n\nVisual Representation of Tag-Sets Relationship\n          \n          Tag-Set: Service and Deployment that share the same label (open in playground)\n          \n                  \n\n\n### 8. Edge - Annotation \n\nThis relationship depicts connections between components without conveying specific semantic meaning.\n\n**Example**: Demonstration of connections between AWS components.\n\nVisual Representation of Edge - Annotation Relationship\n           Edge - Annotation: Relationship between AWS components  (open in playground)\n           \n\n\n\n\n## Selectors in Relationships\n\nIn Meshery, a selector is a way to specify which set of components a certain other component should affect or interact with. Selectors provide a flexible and powerful way to manage and orchestrate resources within a under Meshery's management.\n\nSelectors can be applied to various components, enabling a wide range of relationship definitions. Here are some examples:\n\n\n    \n        Model Component\n        Relationship Kind\n        Relationship SubType\n        Model Component\n    \n    \n        Kubernetes ConfigMap\n        Hierarchical\n        Inventory\n        Kubernetes Pod\n    \n    \n        Kubernetes ConfigMap\n        Hierarchical\n        Inventory\n        Kubernetes Deployment\n    \n    \n        Meshery WASMFilter\n        Hierarchical\n        Inventory\n        Istio EnvoyFilter\n    \n\n\nThe above relationships pairs have hierarchical inventory relationships, and visual paradigm remain consistent across different components. A snippet of the selector backing this relationship is listed below.\n\nExample Relationship Selector\n\n\"selector\": {\n    \"allow\": {\n        \"from\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"ConfigMap\",\n            \"model\": \"kubernetes\",\n            \"patch\": {\n              \"patchStrategy\": \"replace\",\n              \"mutatorRef\": [\n                [\n                  \"name\"\n                ]\n              ],\n              \"description\": \"In Kubernetes, ConfigMaps are a versatile resource that can be referenced by various other resources to provide configuration data to applications or other Kubnernetes resources.\\n\\nBy referencing ConfigMaps in these various contexts, you can centralize and manage configuration data more efficiently, allowing for easier updates, versioning, and maintenance of configurations in a Kubernetes environment.\"\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        \"to\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n            \"model\": \"kubernetes\",\n            \"patch\": {\n              \"patchStrategy\": \"replace\",\n              \"mutatedRef\": [\n                [\n                  \"settings\",\n                  \"spec\",\n                  \"containers\",\n                  \"_\",\n                  \"envFrom\",\n                  \"0\",\n                  \"configMapRef\",\n                  \"name\"\n                ]\n              ],\n              \"description\": \"ConfigMaps can be referenced in the Pod specification to inject configuration data into the Pod's environment.\\n\\nThe keys from the ConfigMap will be exposed as environment variables to the container within the Pod.\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe above snippet defines a selector configuration for allowing relationships between `Kubernetes ConfigMap` and `Kubernetes Pod`.\n\n \n\n## Relationship Evaluation\n\nMeshery employs a policy-driven approach to evaluate relationships between components. This evaluation helps in:\n\n- Determining compatible components for establishing relationships\n- Suggesting potential relationships based on the current design\n- Validating existing relationships and identifying potential conflicts\n- Automating the configuration of components based on established relationships\n\n![Meshery Relationship](/assets/img/concepts/logical/relationship-evaluation-flow.svg)\n\n### How Relationships are formed?\n\n1. You can create relationships manually by using the edge handles, bringing related components to close proximity or dragging a component inside other component. It may happen that, you created a relationship from the UI, but the Policy Engine rejected or overrode the decision if all the constraints for a particular relationship are not satisfied.\n\n2. Relationships are automatically created when a component's configuration is modified in a way that relationship criteria is satisfied.\n\n{% include/alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Explore an example relationship\" content=\"To explore an example of this behavior, see the Example Edge-Permission Relationship and follow the steps written in its description.\" %}\n\nWhen the relationships are created by the user, almost in all cases the config of the involved components are patched. To see the specific of patching refer [Patch Strategies](#patch-strategies).\n\nDesigns are evaluated by the [Policy Engine]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/policies) for potential relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Patch Strategies\n\nPatches in Meshery relationships utilize strategies and references (mutatorRef/mutatedRef) for the from and to fields. These convey the property path that will be updated as the relationship is created.\n\n### Caveats and Considerations\n\n1. If the user creates a `Hierarchical Inventory` relationship between `Pod`, `Job`, and any other high-level Kubernetes resources like `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, or `CronJobs`, after the relationship has been established unfortunately, there’s no system to remove the extra pod configuration automatically.\nIf the design is not configured with `labels` `selectors` and `replicas` appropriately, there's a possibility of additional resources getting provisioned when deployed. eg: The relationship between a Pod and deployment can result in 2 Pods (1 pod coming as part of deployment resource) and 1 Deployment.  It’s important to be aware of this possibility and manage configurations carefully to avoid unexpected issues during deployment\n\n# Itemizing your Relationship Definitions in your Meshery deployment\n\nIn any given Meshery deployment, you can reference and search the full set of registered relationships (in Meshery's internal registry) in using either of Meshery's client interfaces.\n\n**Meshery UI**\n\n- Visit _Setttings_ --> _Registry_\n\n**Meshery CLI**\n\n- Run `mesheryctl relationship list`"

						"content": "Meshery's CLI, `mesheryctl`, includes commands for verifying system readiness for a Meshery deployment and health checks to confirm the health of an existing Meshery deployment. Whether you have yet to deploy Meshery or have already deployed Meshery, `mesheryctl system check` is a useful utility to ensure that your Meshery deployments are healthy.\n\n\nmesheryctl system check\n\n\n\nVerify environment pre/post-deployment of Meshery.\n\nUsage:\nmesheryctl system check [flags]\n\nFlags:\n--adapter Check status of Meshery adapters\n-h, --help help for check\n--operator Check status of Meshery operators\n--pre Verify environment readiness to deploy Meshery\n--preflight Verify environment readiness to deploy Meshery\n\nGlobal Flags:\n--config string path to config file (default \"/Users/navendu/.meshery/config.yaml\")\n-c, --context string (optional) temporarily change the current context.\n-v, --verbose verbose output\n-y, --yes (optional) assume yes for user interactive prompts.\n\n\n## Deployment checks\n\n`mesheryctl system check` command can run two types of system checks. A pre-deployment check which verifies the environment to deploy Meshery and a post-deployment check which runs validation checks on a running Meshery deployment.\n\n### Pre-deployment checks\n\nPre-deployment checks runs checks on the environment and verifies whether it is ready for deploying Meshery.\n\nThe following checks are done here:\n\n- Docker health checks: Checks for the availability of Docker and docker-compose in the user's machine\n- Kubernetes health checks: Checks for the availability of a Kubernetes cluster and checks if Meshery can initialize a Kubernetes client\n- Kubernetes version checks: Checks if kubectl and the Kubernetes version are higher than the minimum supported versions\n\nPre-deployment checks are run with the `--preflight` flag as shown below:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check --preflight\n\n\n### Post-deployment checks\n\nPost-deployment checks are run after deploying Meshery in the user's environment. These checks ensure that the running deployment of Meshery and Meshery adapters are working as expected.\n\nIn addition to the pre-flight checks, the following checks are also run in this check:\n\n- Meshery version checks: Checks the version of Meshery server and CLI and shows if a new version is available\n- Meshery Adapter health checks: Checks if all the specified adapters are deployed and reachable\n\nPost-deployment checks are run as shown below:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check\n\n\n## Additional checks\n\nTo check the status of the deployed adapters only, users can leverage the `--adapter` flag as shown below:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check --adapter\n\n\nUsers can also narrow down the tests to just check the status of the Meshery operator deployed on their Kubernetes cluster:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check --operator\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n##### Question: While running `mesheryctl system check --preflight` it says I didn't install Kubernetes, but I have Docker installed and the test returned \"Meshery prerequisites met\". Is that all good?\n\n**Answer**: _Yes, as long as you've Docker installed, it's fine to run Meshery. But you will need a Kubernetes cluster to handle tasks such as deploying infrastructure and so on, if you want to do them via Meshery._\n\n##### Question: I ran a preflight check to see if I satisfy all requirements for Meshery in my system. It returned positive results but I couldn't start Meshery. What to do?\n\n**Answer**: _Make sure if you've configured your system to run Meshery in smooth manner. For configuration, do check out the docs site and [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation) to see instructions related to the platform you use._\n\n##### Question: Do I need a Kubernetes cluster or will a Docker host suffice for Meshery deployments?\n\n**Answer**: _Meshery's [performance management](tasks/performance/managing-performance) functionality does not require a Kubernetes cluster. The rest of Meshery's functionality (e.g. cloud native management) does require a Kubernetes cluster._\n\n##### Question: What are Meshery's production deployment requirements?\n\n**Answer**: _One or more Kubernetes clusters. A stateful set for Meshery Server in order to persist performance test results. See [#2451](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/2451)._\n\n##### Question: For system checks, do I need any add-ons to pass the check?\n\n**Answer**: _Not necessary. Basic requirements are enough to pass the check._\n\n##### Question: The Adapter check is failing, it returns \"Auth token not found\".\n\n**Answer**: _You can log in to Meshery using `mesheryctl system login` which would generate an OAuth token. Once the OAuth token is generated, the check will start to function_\n\n##### Question: I have a Kubernetes cluster enabled but Meshery couldn't reach the cluster and the checks are failing! What to do?\n\n**Answer**: _To resolve this error, you can upload your kubeconfig file in the Meshery UI under settings and Meshery will reconfigure to use your Kubernetes cluster._\n\n##### Question: Under Meshery Version test, I'm getting an error like \"CLI is not up-to-date\". Should I update mesheryctl often?\n\n**Answer**: _Yes! You should update the mesheryctl often in order to run Meshery smoothly. The reason behind it is because not only the CLI is updated, but also the Meshery app. So it is advisable to update Meshery often._\n\n##### Question: Is it advisable to keep Meshery in sleep mode while running system checks?\n\n**Answer**: _Not necessary. It is good to keep Meshery up and running, else the system checks will fail to detect the Meshery version._\n\n##### Question: What is the minimum version of k8s cluster and kubectl required to run Meshery?\n\n**Answer**: _For Kubernetes, version >=1.12.0 is recommended. For kubectl version >=1.12 is recommended._\n\n##### Question: In the \"Meshery Adapter\" section of check, I could see only some Meshery adapters up and running and not all. Is this fine?\n\n**Answer**: _Not a problem, if you feel you need to have all mesh adapters to be up running, you can do so by creating a new context `mesheryctl system context create [context-name] --set` (if you voluntarily deleted mesh adapters in your current context)_\n\n##### Question: I started Meshery fresh, didn't change any of the details in the context I have. But I see that all adapter checks are failing. What to do?\n\n**Answer**: _Configure Meshery to use on your Kubernetes cluster, then upload the kubeconfig file via Meshery UI to notify Meshery to use that cluster. If that didn't work, feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues) in GitHub._\n\n### Suggested Reading\n\nFor an exhaustive list of `mesheryctl` commands and syntax:\n\n- See [`mesheryctl` Command Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/mesheryctl).\n\nGuides to using Meshery's various features and components.\n\n{% capture tag %}\n\nUpgrading mesheryctl\n\n{% endcapture %}\n\n{% include related-discussions.html tag=\"mesheryctl\" %}"

We investigate every report thoroughly.\n\nTo make a report, send an email to the private\n[security@meshery.dev](mailto:security@meshery.dev)\nmailing list with the vulnerability details. For normal product bugs\nunrelated to latent security vulnerabilities, please head to\nthe appropriate repository and submit a [new issue](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/new/choose).\n\n### When to report a security vulnerability?\n\nSend us a report whenever you:\n\n- Think Meshery has a potential security vulnerability.\n- Are unsure whether or how a vulnerability affects Meshery.\n- Think a vulnerability is present in another project that Meshery\ndepends on (Docker for example).\n\n### When not to report a security vulnerability?\n\nDon't send a vulnerability report if:\n\n- You need help tuning Meshery components for security.\n- You need help applying security related updates.\n- Your issue is not security related.\n\nInstead, join the community [Slack](https://slack.meshery.io/) and ask questions.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe Meshery team acknowledges and analyzes each vulnerability report within 10 working days.\n\nAny vulnerability information you share with the Meshery team stays\nwithin the Meshery project. We don't disseminate the information to other\nprojects. We only share the information as needed to fix the issue.\n\nWe keep the reporter updated as the status of the security issue is addressed.\n\n### Fixing the issue\n\nOnce a security vulnerability has been fully characterized, a fix is developed by the Meshery team.\nThe development and testing for the fix happens in a private GitHub repository in order to prevent\npremature disclosure of the vulnerability.\n\n### Early disclosures\n\nThe Meshery project maintains a mailing list for private early disclosure of security vulnerabilities. \nThe list is used to provide actionable information to close Meshery partners. The list is not intended \nfor individuals to find out about security issues.\n\n### Public disclosures\n\nOn the day chosen for public disclosure, a sequence of activities takes place as quickly as possible:\n\n- Changes are merged from the private GitHub repository holding the fix into the appropriate set of public\nbranches.\n\n- Meshery team ensures all necessary binaries are promptly built and published.\n\n- Once the binaries are available, an announcement is sent out on the following channels:\n  - The [Meshery blog](https://meshery.io/blog/)\n  - The [Meshery Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/mesheryio)\n  - The [#announcements](https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/CSF3PSZT9) channel on community [Slack](https://slack.meshery.io/)\n\nAs much as possible this announcement will be actionable, and include any mitigating steps customers can take prior to upgrading to a fixed version."

When pairs of Labels or Annotations match, a relationship is established and visualized as shown below.\n\n\n\nYou can group components using tags. Tags are key-value pairs that help you organize and categorize components within your design. Tags can be used to visually group components. You can also use tags to filter components and view only those that match the tag criteria.\n\n## Labels and Annotations\n\nDesigns support two different types of tags: Labels and Annotations. Labels are often used to identify components and are visible on the design canvas. Annotations are often used to provide additional information about components.\n\n\nPerformance Consideration\nTags are indexed and searchable. However, the performance of design operations may degrade as the number of tags increases. To ensure an optimal user experience, we recommend using tags judiciously and limiting the number of tags used in a design.\n\nUpon loading a design exceeds that exceeds 10 tags within a single design, Kanvas will automatically disable grouping by tags. You can manually enable grouping by tags by clicking the “Group Components” button in the Designer dock."

						"categories": "",
						"url": " /extensibility/ui",
						"content": "Meshery UI has a number of extension points that allow users to customize their experience with third-party plugins.\n\n## Designing Custom Components for Meshery Extension Point\n\nThe Meshery extension points are the way to extend meshery and derive the more custom use-cases out of it. We already have an extension point called Kanvas.\nMeshery can provide the extension point in various ways by providing the feature of custom-components. One of the example where these custom components are used is RJSF forms in meshery-extension\n\n### Extensibility: RJSF Custom Component\n\nRJSFWrapperComponent are the customizations done on RJSF forms overriding the default behaviour of meshery-ui rjsf forms.\nThe [Rjsf forms are wrapped](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/0bc68d1cd0ba80a565afa68bce80899c22db9a2e/ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/RJSF.js#L66) under these component to receive the custom-props from Meshery-extension.\n{% capture code_content %} \n {\nsetData(e.formData)\n}}\njsonSchema={jsonSchema}\n/>\n{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nThese props are received in the RJSF forms like this: [RJSF Component](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/0bc68d1cd0ba80a565afa68bce80899c22db9a2e/ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/RJSF.js#L91)\n\n### Extensibility: User Accounts\n\nMeshery leverages remote providers for identity management. These providers can implement user_account extensions to handle custom user management scenarios.\n\nThe user avatar behavior, which changes based on the user's status, can be customized by extending the [User Component](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/7de49ef4928f114080f923f2ad261f4433ca91d6/ui/components/User.js#L46).\n\n\n###  Build-Time UI Extensibility\n\nMeshery offers powerful customization options for its web application user interface at build time. This feature allows developers to tailor the UI to specific needs by modifying component behavior, managing routes, and applying custom themes.\n\n##### Configuration File\n\nThe build-time UI customization is controlled through the `ui.config.js` file. This file supports various configuration options to modify the Meshery UI.\n\n##### Current Features\n\n*Component Management*\n\nYou can control the visibility and behavior of various UI components. For example:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  components: {\n    navigator: true, // Set to false to disable the navigator component (default: true)\n    // Add other components here as needed\n  },\n};\n```\n\n*Upcoming Features*\n\nMeshery is continuously expanding its UI extensibility capabilities. The following features are planned for future releases:\n\n1. **Route Management**: Ability to disable or modify specific routes.\n1. **Redirect Configuration**: Set up custom redirects within the application.\n1. **Custom Theming**: Apply custom themes to personalize the look and feel of the Meshery UI.\n\n#### Usage\n\nTo customize the Meshery UI:\n\n1. Locate the `ui.config.js` file in your Meshery project.\n1. Modify the configuration options according to your requirements.\n1. Rebuild the Meshery application to apply your changes.\n\n\n#### Passing new custom prop to forms:\n\n1.  Pass the new prop from the Meshery Extension in the RJSF Wrapper component used like this:\n\n{% capture code_content %} function RJSFWrapperComponent(props) {\n// Clone the child to pass in additional props\nconst children = React.cloneElement(props.children, {\n...(props.children?.props || {}),\ncustomComponent: YOUR_NEW_CUSTOM_COMPONENT_OR_PROP\n});\n\nreturn children\n}{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nExtract the props in the [RJSFForm Component](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/0bc68d1cd0ba80a565afa68bce80899c22db9a2e/ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/RJSF.js#L91)\n\n_Extensibility documentation missing?_\nSubmit an issue to request more documentation.\n\n### Extension Points by File\n\n1. **/ui/components/NavigatorExtension.js** - add custom menu items in Meshery's main navigation menu.\n1. **/ui/pages/extension/[component].js** - optionally, define the state of a parent menu item: expanded or collapsed.\n1. **ui/remote-component.config.js** - list of Material UI components made available to Remote Providers and their plugins.\n1. **ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternServiceFormCore.js** - PatternServiceFormCore component which decouples the SettingsForm and TraitsForm from their UI representation while keeping the logic coupled. This design lets the Remote Provider amend the design of the components without interfering with Meshery UI's core logic.\n\n### Using React JSON Schema Form\n\nMeshery exposes a custom RJSF Form component which is capable of generating \"Pattern\" YAMLs without being extremely opinionated about the UI. This custom component is available at `ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternServiceFormCore.js`. An example usage of the component which will render the logically coupled `SettingsForm` and `TraitsForm` in a Material UI `TabPanel`:\n\n{% capture code_content %} \n\n    {(SettingsForm, TraitsForm) => {\n    \treturn (\n    \t\t\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\n    \t);\n    }}\n\n{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\nMeshery UI's RJSF form accepts two props:\n\n- `RJSFWrapperComponent`: The wrapper component gets all of the props that are passed to the underlying form, allowing to inspect the props and changing the behaviour based on them.\n- `RJSFFormChildComponent`: This component will customize the internals of the RJSF form.\n\nWith both of these props, Remote Providers can customize the wrapper and can also customize the body of the form. This allows full customization of the form.\n\nfrom _ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/index.js_\n{% include code.html code=\"function PatternService({ formData, jsonSchema, onChange, type, onSubmit, onDelete, RJSFWrapperComponent, RJSFFormChildComponent })\" %}"

If you don't have an account, sign up at [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io/).\n\n### Lab Scenario\n\n- Import the WordPress and MySQL manifest files into Meshery Playground.\n\n- Create persistent volumes and a secret for the resources using the visual tools provided by Meshery.\n\n- Deploy these resources on the playground.\n\nIn this lab, you will import the WordPress and MySQL manifest files into Meshery Playground. You will visualize these Kubernetes resources and create persistent volumes for them using the visual tools provided by Meshery. Finally, you will deploy these resources on the Playground.\n\n### Objective\n\nLearn how to import manifest files, visualize Kubernetes resources, create new resource components, and deploy the application using Meshery Playground.\n\n### Steps\n\n#### Download the Kubernetes Configuration Files\n\nGo ahead and download these yaml files [mysql-deployment.yaml](https://kubernetes.io/examples/application/wordpress/mysql-deployment.yaml) and [wordpress-deployment.yaml](https://kubernetes.io/examples/application/wordpress/wordpress-deployment.yaml)\n\nThese YAML files contain the Service definitions, Persistent Volume Claims, and Deployment configurations for the WordPress site and the MySQL database.\n\n#### Access Meshery Playground\n\n1. Log in to the [Meshery Playground](https://cloud.layer5.io/) using your credentials. On successful login, you should be at the dashboard. Press the **X** on the _Where do you want to start?_ popup to close it (if required).\n\n2. Click **Explore** in the Cloud Native Playground tile to navigate to _Kanvas_\n\n#### Import the Files to Meshery Playground\n\n1. In the left sidebar, click on the upward arrow symbol(import icon) to import the designs into Meshery.\n\n2. In the modal that appears:\n   - Enter a name for your design in the \"Design File Name\" field (e.g.`mysql-deployment`).\n\n   - Select `Kubernetes Manifest` from the \"Design Type\" dropdown menu.\n\n        ![Import modal](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp1.png)\n\n   - Choose `File Upload` for the upload method, and select the file you just downloaded.\n\n   - Then, click on `Import`\n\n        ![Import mysql-deployment](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp2.png)\n\n3. Under the \"Designs\" tab, you will see that we have successfully imported the `mysql-deployment` design.\n\n   When you click on the names of the designs on the `Designs` tab, you can see the visual representations of the various Kubernetes resources and their relationships on the canvas.\n\n    ![Imported designs on canvas](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp3.png)\n\n4. Now, follow the same steps to import the `wordpress-deployment` file.\n\n    ![wordpress-deployment](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp4.png)\n\n#### Merging the Designs\n\nNext, we will combine the WordPress and MySQL designs into a single design file. By merging these designs, we can manage and deploy both resources together.\n\nTo merge the MySQL deployment design with the WordPress deployment design:/\n1. Click and drag the `mysql-deployment` design from the left panel and drop it onto the design canvas of the `wordpress-deployment`.\n\n    ![drag and drop design](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp5.png)\n\n2. This action will open a merge modal asking if you want to merge the design, Click on `Merge`.\n\n    ![merge modal](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp6.png)\n\n3. Click on `Save As` and enter `wordpress-mysql-deployment` as the new file name.\n\n    ![save design](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp7.png)\n\n#### Create and Configure Secret for MySQL Database\n\nIn this step, we need to create a Kubernetes secret component for the MySQL database. This is necessary because of this configuration in the environment variables section of the mysql-deployment yaml file.\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n- name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD\n  valueFrom:\n    secretKeyRef:\n      name: mysql-pass\n      key: password\n```\n\nBefore you proceed, choose a password and convert it into base64 format. You can use an online tool for this conversion. For this example the password is `password` and its base64 encoding is `cGFzc3dvcmQ=`\n\n1. Click on the Kubernetes icon on the dock, search for `secret`, and click on it or drag it to the canvas.\n\n    ![Create secret component](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp8.png)\n\n2. Click on the Secret component to open the configuration window.\n\n    - Set the _name_ as `mysql-pass`\n    - Set the _Type_ as `Opaque`.\n    - Click **+** next to Data and add the secret as a key value pair `password:cGFzc3dvcmQ=`\n\n        ![Configure secret](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp9.png)\n\n3. Click outside the window to close the configuration tab.\n\n#### Create Persistent Volumes\n\nMySQL and WordPress each require a [Persistent Volume(PV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) to store their data.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will use the `manual` StorageClassName and set the Persistent Volume to use the `hostPath` type.\n\nPlease note that using `hostPath` for Persistent Volumes is generally not recommended for production environments because it ties the volume to the node's filesystem, which can lead to data loss if the node fails. However, we can use it in this tutorial for development purposes.\n\n1. Click on the Kubernetes icon on the dock, search for `Persistent Volume`, and select it. We will create two PV's.\n\n    ![Create persistent volume](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp10.png)\n\n2. Click on the wordpress PV to open the configuration window.\n\n    - Change the \"name\" to `wp-pv`\n    - Set the \"StorageClassName\" as `manual`\n    - Click **+** next to \"AccessMode\" and enter `ReadWriteOnce`\n\n        ![Configure persistent volume](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp11.png)\n\n    - Scroll down to \"Capacity\" and enter in the key pair `storage:20Gi`\n\n        ![Persistent volume capacity](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp12.png)\n\n    - Scroll down to \"Hostpath\" and input `mnt/data/wp-pv` for the _path_ and `DirectoryOrCreate` for the _type_.\n\n        ![Persistent volume hostpath](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp13.png)\n\n3. Repeat similar steps for the Mysql Persistent Volume\n\n    - Click on the MySQL PV to open the configuration window.\n    - Change the \"name\" to `mysql-pv`\n    - Set the \"StorageClassName\" to `manual`\n    - Click **+** next to \"AccessMode\" and set it to `ReadWriteOnce`\n    - Scroll down to \"Capacity\", and enter the key pair `storage:20Gi`\n    - Scroll down to \"Hostpath\" and input `mnt/data/mysql-pv` for the _path_ and `DirectoryOrCreate` for the _type_.\n\n4. Click on `wp-pv-claim` and `mysql-pv-claim` and set their \"StorageClassName\" as `manual`\n\n#### Add Labels\n\nTo make it easier to filter and manage our resources during visualization, let's add labels to all of them.\n\n You can also choose to use the existing label, `app:wordpress`, but a new one, `dev:tutorial`, is recommended for this tutorial to prevent our resources from getting mixed up with others in the public playground cluster.\n\n1. Click on the label icon.\n2. Click the **+** sign next to Labels.\n3. Add the label `dev:tutorial`.\n4. Do this for **all** the resources on the canvas.\n\n    ![Add label](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp14.png)\n\n5. Now click on `Save As` and save the design.\n\n#### Group Components\n\nThe _**Group Components**_ icon on the dock below allows you to group resources based on shared labels or annotations.\n\nThis functionality aids in visualizing the relationships between various resources, making it easier to manage them, troubleshoot issues, and understand the overall cluster architecture.\n\n![Group Components](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp21.png)\n\n#### Deploy the Resources\n\n1. Click `Actions` in the top right corner and click on `Deploy`.\n\n    ![Actions dropdown menu](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp15.png)\n\n2. The design will be validated to make sure there are no errors.\n\n    ![Validate design](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp16.png)\n\n3. Choose the Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy to.\n\n    ![Choose deployment Environment](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp17.png)\n\n    **_Note_**: The Meshery Playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full control over these clusters but you can also have the option to add your own Kubernetes cluster to the Playground.\n\n4. Finally click `Deploy` to deploy the application to the cluster.\n\n    ![Deploy resources](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp18.png)\n\n5. To check the status of your deployment, click on the notification icon on the top right corner. You can click on `Open In visualizer` to navigate to the Visualize section or follow the steps below.\n\n    ![Deploy resources](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp22.png)\n\n\n#### Visualizing the Deployed Resources\n\nTo view the resources deployed we will use the Visualize section of the _Kanvas_. In this section, you can apply filters to display the specific resources you want to see.\n\n1. Move to the Visualize tab.\n2. Click the filter icon and choose the appropriate filters\n\n    - For \"Kinds\" select `Deployment`, `Service`, `PersistentVolume`, `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `Secret`\n    - For the \"label\" select `dev=tutorial`\n\n3. You can also use the icons on the right sidebar to filter the resources.\n\n    After selecting your filters, you should see a view displaying only your relevant resources, as shown in the image below.\n\n    ![Filter resources](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp19.png)\n\n#### Resource Details\n\nYou can click on any resource to view more details about it in the \"Details\" section on the right sidebar.\n\n**Deployment**\n\n![Get more details about deployment](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp23.png)\n\n**Service**\n\nThe Service details only display the cluster IP for now. So there is no means for us to access the application externally.\n\n![Get more details about service](/pages/guides/tutorials/wordpress-mysql-persistentvolume/wp20.png)\n\n#### Deleting Resources\n\nTo delete the resources, use the `Undeploy` option from the Action dropdown in the _Design_ tab.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully completed the tutorial on deploying a WordPress site and MySQL database with Persistent Volumes using Meshery Playground. This hands-on experience should have given you valuable insights into importing manifest files, visualizing resources, creating persistent volumes, and managing deployments in Meshery Playground."

						"id": "guides-mesheryctl-working-with-mesheryctl",
						"title": "Using Meshery CLI",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /guides/mesheryctl/working-with-mesheryctl",
						"content": "Meshery's command line interface is `mesheryctl`. Use `mesheryctl` to both manage the lifecyle of Meshery itself and to access and invoke any of Meshery's application and cloud native management functions. `mesheryctl` commands can be categorized as follows:\n\n- `mesheryctl` - Global overrides and flags\n- `mesheryctl app` - Cloud Native Application Management\n- `mesheryctl filter` - Cloud Native Filter Management\n- `mesheryctl mesh` - Cloud Native Lifecycle & Configuration Management\n- `mesheryctl perf` - Cloud Native Performance Management\n- `mesheryctl design` - Cloud Native Pattern Configuration & Management\n- `mesheryctl system` - Meshery Lifecycle and Troubleshooting\n\n## Configuring Meshery Deployments with meshconfig\n\n_Meshconfig_ refers to a configuration file found at `~/.meshery/config.yaml`. Your meshconfig file must contain one or more `contexts` in order for any `mesheryctl system` command to work. Each context represents a Meshery deployment.\n\nEach of the `system` commands are used to control Meshery's lifecycle like `system start`, `stop`, `status`, `reset` and so on.\n\n## Meshery CLI FAQ\n\n#### Question: What is the meshconfig?\n\nLike kubeconfig for `kubectl`, meshconfig is the name of your `mesheryctl` config file. You can find your meshconfig file in its default location of `~/.meshery/config.yaml`. By default, `mesheryctl` will look to this location for your meshconfig. You can override the default location at anytime with the use of the global parameter, `--config `.\n\n#### Question: What is a context?\n\nA meshconfig `context` represents a single Meshery deployment. Using `context`s, you can configure different Meshery deployments with environment-specific settings and you can easily switching between your individual Meshery deployments by updating your current-context.\n\n#### Question: Why are contexts necessary?\n\nMany Meshery users have more than one Meshery deployment. Contexts allow you to deploy different versions of Meshery, update your release channel subscription settings, selectively install one or more Meshery Adapters, and so on. Contexts allow you to configure your individual Meshery deployments.\n\n#### Question: What is `current-context`?\n\n`current-context` identifies the Meshery deployment that when any `mesheryctl` command is invoked will use the environment described in the `current-context`. You can switch between contexts. Only one context can be the `current-context`.\n\n#### Question: What's the difference between contexts and environments?\n\nContexts configure Meshery deployments (server, adapters, operator and so on), while environments define a collection of Kubernetes clusters and cloud native infrastructure under management in Meshery.\n\n#### Question: What does the default meshconfig look like?\n\nThe following template is used to create a config file from scratch. Not all of the following variables are required to be included. Some of the variables may have a null value or may be excluded (e.g. “adapters”).\n\n```\ncontexts:\n    :\n      endpoint: \n      token: \n      platform: \n      # Future: specify type of kubernetes (e.g. eks)\n      adapters: \n\n   :\n    endpoint: \n    token: \n    platform: \n    current-context: \n\ntokens:\n- name: \n  location: \n- name: \n  value: \n  # Future: allow embedding of token certificate\n```\n\nTry it out and see for yourself. Run `mesheryctl system context create test` and `mesheryctl system context view test`.\n\n#### Question: How do endpoints work in meshconfig?\n\nEndpoints specify the access URL for the Meshery UI, for a deployment. Endpoints are developed based on platform:\n\n- Docker: Docker users can specify the endpoint in the meshconfig. The port specified in this will be used to generate the endpoint. The endpoint is of the form `http://localhost:port`, where `port` is taken from the meshconfig.\n- Kubernetes: Deployments with kubernetes as the platform have an endpoint generated by service discovery using the Kubernetes API. This endpoint overwrites the endpoint specified in the meshconfig.\n\n#### Question: Can I get an API token using mesheryctl?\n\nYes, if you need to establish a session with your Meshery Server, you can [authenticate using mesheryctl](/guides/mesheryctl/authenticate-with-meshery-via-cli), using `mesheryctl system login`.\n\n## Advanced Installation\n\nUsers can control the specific container image and tag (version) of Meshery that they would like to run by editing their local _~/.meshery/meshery.yaml_ (a docker compose file).\nAligned with the Meshery container image, instead of leaving the implicit :stable-latest tag behind image: layer5/meshery, users will instead identify a specific image tag like so:\n\n{% capture code_content %}bash\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  meshery:\n    image: layer5/meshery:v0.5.0\n    labels:\n      - \"com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true\"{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n### Suggested Reading\n\nFor an exhaustive list of `mesheryctl` commands and syntax:\n\n- See [`mesheryctl` Command Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/mesheryctl).\n\nGuides to using Meshery's various features and components.\n\n{% capture tag %}\n\nUpgrading mesheryctl\n\n{% endcapture %}\n\n{% include related-discussions.html tag=\"mesheryctl\" %}\n\n\n\n\n\n{% include discuss.html %}"

						"url": " /concepts/logical/workspaces",
						"content": "Like a Google Drive, Meshery Workspaces serve as a virtual space for your team-based work. Create a Workspace to organize your work and to serve as the central point of collaboration for you and your teams and a central point of access control to Environments and their resources.\n\nYou may create Workspaces to organize project-based work or to create domains of responsibility for your teams or segregate Designs and Environments and track team activity.\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"dark\" title=\"Your team collaboration point\" content=\"Workspaces facilitate collaboration between you and your teams, allow you to control access to resources, and track activity and report on related events.\" %}\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Resource Sharing** Workspaces allow for seamless resource sharing among team members, fostering collaboration.\n- **Logical Grouping** Within Workspaces, you can group related components such as environments and infrastructure designs.\n- **Flexibility**: Workspaces support various resources like Kubernetes, Prometheus, Jaeger, Nginx, and more.\n- **Simplified Management** Managing and deploying resources is made easy within Workspaces.\n- **Access Control** Workspaces allow you to control access to resources by granting permissions to users and teams.\n\n### Workspace Relationships and Restrictions\n\n- Access to Workspaces may be granted to one or more teams.\n- As a point of collaboration to facilitate work, Workspaces may have zero or more Environments associated.\n\nAfter creating a Workspace, of your next steps is to resource that Workspace. Like a shared drive (or or shared collection of files). Workspaces are your Google Drive, while Meshery Designs are your Google Docs.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### Environments\n\n- Environments are a central part of a workspace. They serve as a logical grouping for managing connections. A connection, in this context, can be either managed or discovered by Meshery. Examples of connections include Kubernetes clusters, Prometheus instances, Jaeger traces, Nginx servers, and more.\n- One or more environments can be assigned to a workspace.\n- Same environment can be assigned to multiple workspaces.\n\nSee \"[Environments](/concepts/logical/environments)\" section for more information.\n\n### Designs\n\n- Infrastructure Designs are essential for creating reusable deployment templates. Users belonging to teams with access to a workspace can utilize these designs to deploy resources in the Kubernetes clusters associated with that workspace.\n- Like a shared drive (or or shared collection of files), Workspaces are your Google Drive, while Meshery Designs are your Google Docs.\n- One ore more designs can be assigned to a workspace.\n- Same design can be assigned to multiple workspaces.\n\nSee \"[Meshery Designs](/concepts/logical/designs)\" section for more information.\n\n### Organizations\n\n- Organizationa are the unit of tenancy in Meshery. Organizations group users together.\n- Organizations own all resources created by users, like Workspaces, Designs, Environments, and so on.\n- Remote Providers can extend Meshery to include additional identity and user management features like heirarchical organizations, or teams (as user groups), and so on.\n- Remote Providers can extend Meshery to offer fine-grained permissions and access control to resources like Workspaces, Designs, Environments, and so on.\n\nLearn more about [extensible authorization](/extensibility/authorization).\n \n\n\n\n### Connections\n\n- Connections in Meshery refer to various resources that can be either managed or unmanaged, but are discovered and made accessible for use. Examples of Connections include Kubernetes clusters, Prometheus instances, Jaeger services, Nginx deployments, and more. These Connections serve as a fundamental part of Workspaces, as users can deploy infrastructure designs within the context of these Connections.\n- Connections can be assigned to one or more environments.\n- Same connection can be assigned to multiple environments.\n\nSee \"[Connections](/concepts/logical/connections)\" section for more information.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo make the most of Meshery Workspaces, here are some best practices:\n\n- Clearly define permissions in the form of team assignement to ensure proper access control.\n- Use Infrastructure Designs to standardize resource deployments.\n- Regularly review and update your Workspace's resources and configurations.\n\nMeshery Workspaces enhance collaboration within your teams, providing a structured environment for sharing and managing resources. By following best practices and understanding the core components of Workspaces, you can maximize the benefits of this feature in Meshery."

Be sure to reference the _actual_ repo you're contributing to e.g. \"meshery-linkerd\").\n\n\nVerify the new remote named 'upstream'\n\n`git remote -v`\n\nFetch from upstream remote\nYou'll need to fetch the upstream repo's branches and newest commits to bring them into your repository whenever you wish to update your fork with the latest upstream changes:\n\n`git fetch upstream`\n\nCheckout your master branch and merge upstream\n\nNow, checkout your master branch and merge it with the master branch of the upstream repo:\n\n`git checkout master`\n`git merge upstream/master`\n\nIf the local master branch has no unique commits, git will simply execute a fast-forward. However, if you've been making modifications to master (which, in the vast majority of circumstances, you shouldn't be - see the next section), you may run into issues. Always keep in mind the changes made upstream when doing so.\n\nYour local master branch is now up to date with everything that has been changed upstream.\nCreate a Branch (to avoid conflicts)\n\nIt's essential to create a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature or bugfix. Not only is it a standard git workflow, but it also organises and separates your modifications from the main branch, allowing you to simply submit and manage several pull requests for each task you finish.\n\nFollow the steps below to establish a new branch and begin working on it.\n\nCheck out the master branch; from which your new branch will be derived.\n\n`git checkout master`\n\nCreate a new branch (Give your branch a simple, informative name.)\n\nFor continuous integration changes use\n\n`ci/your_username/issue#`  OR\n `feature/your_username/name_of_feature`\n\nFor bugs use\n\n`bug/your_username/issue#` \n OR\n `bug/your_username/name_of_bug`\n\n\n`git branch feature/jdoe/567`\nSwitch to your new branch\n\n`git checkout feature/jdoe/567`\n```(NOTE: Use the name of the branch you created instead of 'feature/jdoe/567'.)```\n\nNow you may start hacking and make any changes you desire.🚀\n\n\nStage the Changes\n\n`git add [files-changed]`\n\n```(NOTE: This will stage all the changes you have made.)```\n\n\nCommit Changes\n\n`git commit -m \"MESSAGE\"`\n\n```(NOTE: Instead of 'MESSAGE,' include a commit message so the maintainer can see what you've done.Also make sure to get the DCO signed.)```\n\n\nCreating Pull Request on Github\n\nBefore submitting your pull request, you should clean up your branch and make it as easy as possible for the maintainer of the original repository to test, accept, and integrate your work.\n\nIf any commits to the upstream master branch have been made during the period you've been working on your changes, you'll need to rebase your development branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward with no conflict resolution work.\n\n\nFetch upstream master and merge with your repo's master branch\n\n`git fetch upstream`\n\n`git checkout master`\n\n`git merge upstream/master`\n\n\nIf there were any new commits, rebase your development branch\n\n`git checkout feature/jdoe/567`\n`git rebase master`\n\nNow, it may be desirable to squash some of your smaller commits down into a small number of larger more cohesive commits. You can do this with an interactive rebase:\n\nRebase all commits on your development branch\n\n\n`git checkout`\n`git rebase -i master`\n\n\nThis will open up a text editor where you can specify which commits to squash.\n\nReferences\nGit Reference Docs\n\ngit-rebase / Interactive Mode\n\nSubmit the Changes\nGo to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, then click the pull request button once you've committed and submitted all of your changes. Simply upload the changes to GitHub if you need to make any changes to your pull request.\n\nYour pull request will track and update changes in your development branch automatically.🌸"

displayName: Kubernetes Deployment with Azure File Storage
createdAt: "2023-11-03T07:47:06Z"
description: This design sets up a Kubernetes Deployment deploying two NGINX containers. Each container utilizes an Azure File storage volume for shared data. The NGINX instances serve web content while accessing an Azure File share, enabling scalable and shared storage for the web servers.

readme: "1. Azure Configuration: Ensure that your Azure configuration, including secrets, is correctly set up to access the Azure File share.\\n\\n2. Data Sharing: Multiple NGINX containers share the same storage. Be cautious when handling write operations to avoid conflicts or data corruption.\\n\\n3. Scalability: Consider the scalability of both NGINX and Azure File storage to meet your application's demands.\\n\\n4. Security: Safeguard the secrets used to access Azure resources and limit access to only authorized entities.\\n\\n5. Pod Recovery: Ensure that the pod recovery strategy is well-defined to handle disruptions or node failures.\\n\\n6. Azure Costs: Monitor and manage costs associated with Azure File storage, as it may incur charges based on usage.\\n\\n7. Maintenance: Plan for regular maintenance and updates of both NGINX and Azure configurations to address security and performance improvements.\\n\\n8. Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerts for both the NGINX containers and Azure File storage to proactively detect and address issues.\\n\\n9. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Establish a backup and disaster recovery plan to safeguard data stored in Azure File storage. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

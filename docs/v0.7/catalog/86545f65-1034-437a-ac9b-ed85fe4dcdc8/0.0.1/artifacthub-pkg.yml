readme: "Developers and operators need to carefully configure readiness and liveness probes to accurately reflect application health. Improper configuration may lead to unnecessary restarts or erroneous scaling decisions, impacting application stability and performance. Additionally, managing Pod life cycles across large-scale deployments requires efficient monitoring and logging frameworks to diagnose and resolve issues promptly. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"

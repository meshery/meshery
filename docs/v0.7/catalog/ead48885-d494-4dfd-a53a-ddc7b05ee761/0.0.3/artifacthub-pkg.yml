description: The Glasskube Operator is an open source Kubernetes operator that aims to simplify the deployment and maintenance of various popular open source tools. Each tool is represented by a new Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) and most user-facing configuration parameters are available via that CRD. philosophy is to emphasize ease-of-use and strong defaults over rich configuration. configurations are designed to cover as many use-cases as possible with minimal user configuration.

Hello everyone, my name is Aary Kinge. I am a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at SRM University. I am excited to begin my open-source journey and look forward to contributing to the Meshery project.

I have a strong interest in Rust and backend systems, and I’m eager to learn from the community while contributing to the ecosystem. My GitHub is [Not-Buddy](https://github.com/Not-Buddy). Looking forward to getting started!

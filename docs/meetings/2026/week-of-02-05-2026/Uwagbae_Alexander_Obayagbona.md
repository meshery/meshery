My name is Uwagbae Alexander Obayagbona.
I am from Nigeria and currently live in Benin City, Nigeria.

I have worked as a Software Engineer for the last 5 years.

After getting my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I was reaffirmed in my choice to work in the Technology space as I encountered technologies in the real world, and started learning them and working with them. 
I discovered I’m genuinely passionate about my field, and I thoroughly enjoy using technology to improve people's lives, i.e., to solve people’s problems.  
Some of my most significant assets are my passion for continuous learning and my dedication and focus on completing a task once I set my mind to it. 
I am a fast learner with proficiencies using DVC Systems like Git, Mercurial, etc., and platforms like GitLab, GitHub, BitBucket, etc. 
I am proficient in JavaScript, C# and PHP programming languages. 
I also have experience building and working with APIs written in C#, PHP & .NET Core, building Web Apps in VanillaJS and using frameworks like Angular, React, Next and Vue.
I have worked remotely with multiple teams of developers, so I regularly use collaboration tools like Slack, Jira, Trello, etc.
I am concerned not just with solving a problem but with doing it in the most efficient way possible with the available resources. 
I am also passionate about open source and helping people.

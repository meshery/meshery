Hi everyone 👋
I’m Joy a Mass Communication graduate who transitioned into software engineering, now specializing in frontend development. My background in communication helps me bridge the gap between users and technology—building interfaces that are not just functional, but clear, intuitive, and user-focused.

I’m excited to be part of the Meshery community, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with developers who care about great UX, performance, and scalable systems. Looking forward to learning, sharing, and growing together! 🚀

# Saurabh Kumar

Hi Meshery Community,  

My name is **Saurabh Kumar**, and I am a final-year **B.Tech Computer Science student from IIIT Gwalior**.  

I am a **full-stack developer** with experience in **Node.js, React, MongoDB, Docker, and cloud-based systems**. I recently worked as a **Software Development Intern at Bluestock Fintech**, where I helped build production-grade APIs, optimized database schemas, and contributed to scalable web applications.  

I joined the **Meshery and Layer5 community** to learn more about **cloud-native technologies, service meshes, Kubernetes ecosystems**, and to contribute to meaningful **open-source infrastructure projects**.  

Looking forward to learning, collaborating, and contributing to Meshery 🚀

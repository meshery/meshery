hey everyone, i’m shubham.
i’m a devops engineer with a little over a year of experience, mostly working with kubernetes and service meshes. i’ve faced the common challenges of managing service meshes, so meshery really resonates with me as a tool that simplifies things. excited to learn and contribute to the meshery community!

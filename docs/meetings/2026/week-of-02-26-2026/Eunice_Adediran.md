Hi! I'm Eunice Adediran, marking my attendance for the newcomer's meeting - week of Feb 26, 2026.

A bit about me:
I'm a DevOps Engineer with experience in cloud-native platforms and Kubernetes. I work with AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code. I'm here to learn, contribute, and grow with the Meshery community.

Looking forward to collaborating and making my first contributions!

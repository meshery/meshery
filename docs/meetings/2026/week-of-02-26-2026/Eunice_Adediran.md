Hi! I'm Eunice Adediran, marking my attendance for the newcomer's meeting - week of Feb 26, 2026.

A bit about me:
I'm a DevOps Engineer with 5+ years of experience building resilient, scalable cloud-native platforms. I specialize in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, OpenShift), CI/CD automation with GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform. I'm passionate about observability, security, and helping teams deliver high-quality software faster.

I'm excited to contribute to Meshery's cloud-native ecosystem and learn from this amazing community. Looking forward to collaborating on Kubernetes infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform engineering challenges!

Hi everyone 👋

I’m Rudra, a sophomore who’s been exploring different areas in tech and building projects along the way. I started with full-stack development in my first year, and I have some experience working with backend development, React, and a bit of Web3 as well.

Recently, I came across Meshery and got really interested in the cloud-native space, so I’ve started learning more about Docker and Kubernetes to better understand how everything works under the hood.

I’m here to learn, contribute, and grow in open source. Really excited to be part of the community and looking forward to connecting and collaborating with you all! 🚀

## Muien

Hi, I'm Muien, a first-year computer science student with a growing interest in backend systems and cloud-native technologies.
I primarily work with Go and Python and have been focusing on improving my understanding of CLI tools, system design fundamentals, and open-source contribution workflows.

I joined the Meshery community to gain real-world experience contributing to a production-grade project and to deepen my understanding of Go-based tooling like mesheryctl.
I'm looking forward to learning, contributing consistently, and collaborating with the community.

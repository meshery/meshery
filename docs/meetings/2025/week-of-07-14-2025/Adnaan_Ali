I'm Mohammad Adnaan Mansoor Ali — a final-year B.Tech student at VNRVJIET, Hyderabad (2026).
I'm a full-stack developer working with Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and the MERN stack. I've contributed to open-source projects like the Community Health Toolkit (CHT) and I'm actively involved in developer communities through programs like Hacktoberfest and GSSoC.

I'm here to dive deep into Meshery, contribute to real engineering problems around cloud-native infrastructure and developer experience, and collaborate with like-minded builders.

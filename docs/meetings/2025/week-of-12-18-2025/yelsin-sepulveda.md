Hello, こにちわ :)

I’m Yelsin Sepulveda - a jr DevOps Engineer and Associate Solutions Architect with experience in C++, Python, Java and tooling like AWS CDK, Terraform, Jenkins, Docker and SDL. While I have professional experience in the tech industry, I am currently expanding my computer science knowledge by finishing my A.S. degree in Boston, MA. I am relatively new to contributing to open-source projects but have been an avid user of Linux and open-source tools for over 4 years and am committed to learning and growing in this community. I've documented my learning journey by creating public repositories from personal projects and coursework.

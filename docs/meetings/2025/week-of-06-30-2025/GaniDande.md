Hey everyone!
I’m Ganeswara Naga Vishnu Teja Dande, but you can just call me Gani. I’m from Hyderabad, Telangana, India, and I’m currently pursuing my Computer Science Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam, Amritapuri.

I’m someone driven by curiosity, always exploring new areas in tech. Over time, I’ve worked with Flutter, Kotlin, Python, Rust, React, DevOps on Azure, and even dabbled in Haskell and blockchain. I’m also actively involved in amFOSS, India’s top open source club, where I mentor juniors and contribute to open source projects.

Outside of tech, I’m a huge fan of cricket and absolutely love watching movies, especially ones that stay with you long after the credits roll.

You can connect with me or check out more of what I do here:

Always happy to talk tech, cricket, movies, or anything under the sun. Looking forward to connecting!

Hi, I'm Saumit!
I'm a DevOps Engineer working in Bangalore, India, with a deep passion for Free and Open Source software. I specialize in Python and Golang, and I'm always excited to dive into new challenges within the tech stack.
I'm particularly interested in contributing to open source projects, especially those in the CNCF landscape, where I believe there's an incredible opportunity to make an impact. Eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the growth of the cloud-native ecosystem.
Looking forward to embarking on this journey!

I'm Aswin Abishek, currently in my 2nd year of Computer Science. 

I'm learning Go and building projects around distributed systems. Recently 
got interested in service mesh technology while exploring cloud-native 
architectures, which led me to Meshery.

Looking to contribute to Layer5 and learn from the community. Excited to 
be here and hoping to participate in GSoC 2026!

Happy to help where I can and learn from everyone.

## 👋 Hey, I'm Aman  

I'm a **Backend Developer** passionate about building scalable and performant systems.

💻 I started my journey as a **MERN developer** during my college years, where I developed a strong foundation in web technologies.
⚙️ Over time, I transitioned to **backend engineering** to explore system design, database management, and scalable architectures.
🚀 Recently, I’ve been diving into **Go (Golang)** — building small projects and learning how to leverage its performance and simplicity for backend systems.
☁️ Alongside backend development, I’m also **exploring DevOps** — learning about CI/CD, containerization, and cloud infrastructure to strengthen my end-to-end understanding of software delivery.

### 🌱 What I’m currently doing
- Expanding my portfolio through **open-source contributions**.
- Exploring **Golang**, **distributed systems**, and **microservices**.
- Continuously improving my backend design and database skills.

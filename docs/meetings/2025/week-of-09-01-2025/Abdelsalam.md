Hi, I'm Abdelsalam Mostafa, a computer scientist from Egypt with a strong passion for problem solving and backend development. I have hands-on experience building projects with Django, Flask, and React, and I also work with C++ for competitive programming, where Iâ€™ve solved 700+ problems on platforms like Codeforces. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, learning new technologies, and applying my skills to real-world projects.

I’m Isha Parte, an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student passionate about web development, cloud computing, and open-source contributions. 
I’ve actively participated in GSSoC and SWoC, where I collaborated on real-world projects and enhanced my development skills.
I enjoy working with the MERN stack and exploring technologies like Cloud Computing and DevOps.

Hi Everyone,
I am Philip Boadu Asare. My friends call me Kwaku. 
I am a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience in the corporate world. I am from Ghana and currently studying in Germany. 
Trying to explore the open-source ecosystem with the hope of improving upon my technical and managerial skills. And also connect with the smart brains behind open source :)

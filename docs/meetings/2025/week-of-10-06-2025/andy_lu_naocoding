Hi everyone, I am Andy. I am currently a student persuing CS degree at NTNU in my third year. 
I found Mershery when I was browsering linux foundation too(same as everyone introduced themselves haha)
and Lee Calcote dm me at the linkedin after couple of days(really appreciate for the informations and conversations from him).
I am currently a SWE intern at Appier and I was a STEP intern at Google this summer. 
After interning and coding for a while I found that I am interesting in contributing open source projects, and I found that it's a very good chance at Meshery and layer5.

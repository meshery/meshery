# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kajal Jotwani  

Iâ€™m an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science Engineering.  
I have contributed to GSoC for Brahma-XR, a library and framework for building collaborative WebXR rooms with spatial data. Currently, I am learning and exploring cloud-native technologies, focusing on Kubernetes and Go, and Iâ€™m super excited to contribute to Meshery.

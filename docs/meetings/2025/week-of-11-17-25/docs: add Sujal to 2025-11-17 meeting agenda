I’m Sujal Tripathi, a 3rd‑year CS student from India, focusing on MERN stack web development and cloud‑native tools. Recently I contributed my first design PR to Meshery: meshery/meshery#16410, which imports the ms-catalogs-worker Helm chart as a Meshery design and successfully publishes it to the Cloud Catalog. I also opened a docs issue layer5io/docs#852 and a follow‑up docs PR layer5io/docs#853 to document the Kanvas “Publish to Catalog” flow for future contributors. I’ve joined the Layer5 community to contribute regularly, prepare for GSoC with Meshery/Layer5, and deepen my understanding of Kubernetes, service meshes, and GitOps while helping improve Meshery’s UI, Kanvas, and documentation.

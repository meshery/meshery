# Tejas Tiwari – Introduction

Hello everyone! 👋

My name is Tejas Tiwari, and I’m excited to join the Meshery community. I am new to open-source development and eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully to the project. I have recently begun exploring mesheryctl and have picked up an issue related to adding end-to-end (E2E) tests using the BATS framework. I look forward to deepening my understanding of Meshery's architecture and improving the testing coverage within the CLI.

In terms of my educational background, I completed my Diploma in Computer Engineering from Y.B. Patil Polytechnic. Currently, I am in my 3rd year at Symbiosis Skills and Professional University (SSPU), pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My academic journey has allowed me to build a strong foundation in programming, cybersecurity, and system-level concepts.

I have an active interest in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and backend development. Open-source has always been something I wanted to be a part of, and Meshery is my first major step into contributing to community-driven cloud native projects. I’m motivated to expand my skills, learn best practices from experienced contributors, and contribute to improving Meshery’s tooling and developer experience.

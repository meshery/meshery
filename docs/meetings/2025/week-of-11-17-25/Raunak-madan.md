I am `Raunak`, an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA) from Bharati Vidyapeeth Institute of Management and Research (BVIMR), New Delhi, India. I am passionate about open-source software, and my journey with Jenkins began in December 2024 after attending KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Delhi, which sparked my interest in these technologies.

In 2025, I was selected for `Google Summer of Code` as a contributor to work on the project *Improving Plugin Modernizer*. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and reading books.

Looking forward to contributing to `Layer 5` and `Meshery`

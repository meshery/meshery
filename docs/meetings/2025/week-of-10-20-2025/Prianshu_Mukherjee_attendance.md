Hey everyone!
I’m Prianshu Mukherjee, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science 
I’m super passionate about Cloud Native technologies, DevOps, and open source, and that’s what led me to Meshery and the broader CNCF ecosystem.
I’ve been working on projects involving Kubernetes, Terraform, and observability stacks, and I’m really excited to contribute to a project like Meshery that’s empowering developers to manage service meshes more intelligently.
I’m looking forward to learning from everyone here, collaborating on issues, and hopefully making meaningful contributions to the community.
Thanks for having me, and I can’t wait to get started!

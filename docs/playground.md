### Deploying service meshes
Meshery supports a number of different service meshes, so that you can learn and compare different service mesh functionality.

### Removing service meshes
Just as Meshery automates the provisioning of various service meshes, so does it faciliate the deprovisioning of service meshes.

### Installing sample apps
Commonly adjoining each service mesh is a sample application that facilitates demonstration of the value of the given service mesh. Meshery allows you to quickly deploy the same sample application across different service meshes.

### Pushing custom service mesh configuration
Meshery provides the ability for you as a service mesh manager to customize your service mesh deployment.

### Notifications 
Meshery tracks service mesh and application health. Meshery provides notification of environment issues, application conflicts with service mesh configuration.

**Acking and dismissing notifications**
Many notifications are informational and can readily be dismissed after reading.

<strong>Taking action on alerts</strong>

Particular notifications that Meshery presents are immediately actionable. These are denoted by a red colored highlight. Be on the lookout for these alerts and take action promptly to ensure a smooth running service mesh.

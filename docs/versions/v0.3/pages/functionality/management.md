Meshery supports a number of [different service meshes]({{ site.baseurl }}/service-meshes), so that you can learn and compare different service mesh functionality. Once you have selected to operate a given service mesh, Meshery will assist you with ongoing activities.

## Service Mesh Lifecycle Management

Meshery automates the provisioning of various service meshes, allowing users to select different configuration profiles in order to support a variety of deployment models.

Meshery adapters will dynamically retrieve the specific service mesh's release package upon initial deployment of a given service mesh. Meshery adapters cache (in `.meshery/bin`) the service mesh installation package.

#### Deleting a service mesh

Just as Meshery automates the provisioning of various service meshes, so does it facilitate the deprovisioning of service meshes.

## Workload Lifecycle Management

Users may bring their applications (perform workload onboarding) on the service mesh using the Custom Configuration operation.

Commonly adjoining each service mesh is a sample application that facilitates demonstration of the value of the given service mesh. Meshery allows you to efficiently [install sample applications]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/deploying-sample-apps) across different service meshes.

## Configuration Management

Meshery provides the ability for you as a service mesh manager to customize your service mesh deployment.

## Notifications

Meshery tracks operations that you perform on service meshes and their workloads. Meshery provides notification of environment issues, application conflicts with service mesh configuration.

#### Acknowledging and dismissing notifications

Many notifications are informational and can readily be dismissed after reading. Some notifications include actionable alerts.

#### Taking action on alerts

Particular notifications that Meshery presents are immediately actionable. These are denoted by a red colored highlight. Be on the lookout for these alerts and take action promptly to ensure a smooth running service mesh.

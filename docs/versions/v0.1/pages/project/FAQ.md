## Question: Why was Meshery created?

**Answer**: _As an open source, vendor neutral project, Meshery was created out the necessity to enable service mesh adopters to overcome the challenge of complex virtual networking; to come to expect more from their infrastructure; to enable the world to understand and operate any service mesh with confidence._

## What is the difference between `make run-local` and `mesheryctl system start`? Do they both run Meshery on my local machine?

**Answer**: _Yes, both of them do run Meshery on your local machine. `make run local` builds Meshery from source and runs it on your local OS, while `mesheryctl system start` runs Meshery as a set of containers in Docker on your local machine._

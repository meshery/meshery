# User Flow Template Guide for Meshery Kanvas

## What is a User Flow?

A User Flow is a diagram that shows the steps a person takes when using an application. It helps you plan and understand how users move through your app.

## What This Template Does

This template helps you create User Flow diagrams in Kanvas. It shows you:
- How to add different parts to your flow
- How to connect them together
- How to make your flow easy to understand

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when you want to:
- Plan a new feature for your app
- Show how users will interact with your system
- Document the steps in a process
- Share your ideas with your team

## Parts of a User Flow

### 1. Start Node
This is where your user flow begins. Every flow needs a starting point.

**When to use:** At the very beginning of your diagram

**Example:** "User opens app" or "User clicks login button"

### 2. User Actions
These show what the user does. Actions are things like clicking, typing, or choosing something.

**When to use:** Whenever the user does something

**Examples:**
- User enters email
- User clicks submit button
- User selects an option

### 3. Decision Points
These are places where the flow can go different ways based on a condition.

**When to use:** When something can happen in more than one way

**Examples:**
- Is the password correct? (Yes/No)
- Does the user have an account? (Yes/No)
- Is the form complete? (Yes/No)

### 4. System Responses
These show what the system does after a user action.

**When to use:** When the app or system reacts to what the user did

**Examples:**
- System checks password
- System saves data
- System sends email

### 5. End States
These show where the flow finishes. Flows can end in different ways.

**When to use:** At the end of your flow

**Examples:**
- Success: User is logged in
- Error: Password is wrong
- Exit: User cancels

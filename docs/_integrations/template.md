## Accessibility Considerations

When contributing to Meshery UI, integrations, and documentation:

- Ensure interactive elements include proper ARIA roles
- Maintain logical keyboard navigation
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Verify compatibility with screen readers

Improving accessibility helps expand inclusivity across the Meshery community.

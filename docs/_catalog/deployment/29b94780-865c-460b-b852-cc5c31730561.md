patternInfo: |
  The design represented by the nginx-deployment.yaml file sets up a basic web server infrastructure using Kubernetes resources.

Key Components:
Namespace (nginx-namespace):

A separate namespace called nginx-namespace is created to isolate and organize the Nginx application and its resources from other applications running in the cluster.
Deployment (nginx-deployment):

Deploys a web server using the Nginx image (nginx:latest).
Two replicas (instances) of the Nginx server are created, ensuring high availability and load distribution across multiple pods.
Each pod in the deployment runs the Nginx container and listens on port 80.
Service (nginx-service):

Exposes the Nginx application to the external network via a LoadBalancer service type.
The service forwards traffic from external clients to the Nginx pods on port 80, making the web server accessible outside the cluster.
The service ensures that traffic is balanced between the two Nginx pods.
Purpose of the Design:
This design demonstrates how to deploy a simple, scalable web server using Kubernetes. By visualizing this in Meshery, you can:

Understand the relationship between different Kubernetes resources (Namespace, Deployment, and Service).
Observe how traffic flows from external clients through the LoadBalancer to the Nginx pods.
Learn the basics of deploying and managing stateless applications in Kubernetes.
Use this as a foundation to explore more advanced Kubernetes concepts like autoscaling, rolling updates, and integration with service meshes.
In summary, this design sets up a highly available Nginx web server with external access and load balancing, making it a fundamental example of how to deploy and expose applications using Kubernetes.
patternCaveats: |
  1. LoadBalancer Requirement: Needs a cloud provider or environment that supports LoadBalancer services; otherwise, external access might not work.
2. Namespace Conflicts: Ensure the nginx-namespace is properly managed to avoid conflicts with existing resources.
3. Resource Availability: The cluster must have enough resources to run the two Nginx replicas.
Default Nginx Config: Uses basic Nginx settings; not suitable for production without customization.

patternInfo: |
  This infrastructure design defines resources related to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Elasticsearch in a Kubernetes environment. Here's a brief description of the components: 1.) zk (ZooKeeper StatefulSet): - A StatefulSet named zk with 3 replicas is defined to manage ZooKeeper instances.   - It uses ordered pod management policy, ensuring that pods are started in order.   - ZooKeeper is configured with specific settings, including ports, data directories, and resource requests.   - It has affinity settings to avoid running multiple ZooKeeper instances on the same node.   - The configuration includes liveness and readiness probes to ensure the health of the pods. 2.) zk-cs (ZooKeeper Service):   - A Kubernetes Service named zk-cs is defined to provide access to the ZooKeeper instances.   - It exposes the client port (port 2181) used to connect to ZooKeeper. 3.) zk-hs (ZooKeeper Headless Service):   - Another Kubernetes Service named `zk-hs` is defined as headless (with cluster IP set to None).   - It exposes ports for ZooKeeper server (port 2888) and leader election (port 3888).   - This headless service is typically used for direct communication with individual ZooKeeper instances. 4.) **zk-pdb (ZooKeeper PodDisruptionBudget):**   - A PodDisruptionBudget named `zk-pdb` is defined to control the maximum number of unavailable ZooKeeper pods to 1.   - This ensures that at least one ZooKeeper instance remains available during disruptions.
patternCaveats: |
  Networking should be properly configured to enable communication between pod and services. Ensure sufficient resources are available in the cluster.

						"content": "General FAQs\n\n\n    \n    Question: What is Meshery?\n\n\nAnswer: As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud native infrastructure.\n\n\n\n    \n    Question: Why was Meshery created?\n\n\nAnswer: As an open source, vendor neutral project, Meshery was created out of the necessity to enable platform engineers, site reliability engineers, devops engineers... engineers to collaborate in the management of their infrastucture and workloads. Meshery was created to enable you to expect more from your infrastructure and to do so with confidence.\n\n\n\n    \n    Question: What does Meshery do?\n\n\nAnswer: Infrastructure as design. Meshery enables you to design and operate cloud native infrastructure visually, collaboratively, with confidence and in partnership with your teammates.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Question: Is Meshery open source project?\n\nAnswer: Yes, Meshery is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project and is licensed under Apache v2. As the cloud native management plane, Meshery is an extensible platform, offering multiple extension points within which users and partners can customize and extend Meshery's functionality.\n\n\n\n    \nQuestion: Why should I use Meshery?\n\nAnswer: Meshery is a powerful tool for managing ​Kubernetes infrastructure. It seamlessly integrates with different hundreds of tools and offers extensibility through many different extension points. With Meshery, you can easily discover your environment, collaboratively manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, connect your Git and Helm repos, and analyze app and infra performance.\n\n\nUser FAQs\n\n\n    \n    Question: What is mesheryctl?\n\nAnswer: A command line interface to manage Meshery. `mesheryctl` can manage any number of Meshery deployments.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How do I install Meshery?\n\nAnswer: Meshery runs on a number of platforms. You are encouraged to use mesheryctl to configure and control Meshery deployments. Install `mesheryctl` using any of these options:\n\nBash user\nBrew user\nScoop user\nDirect download\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What architecture does Meshery have?\nAnswer: An extensible architecture. There are several components, languages and they have different purposes. See Meshery's Architecture.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between make server and mesheryctl system start? Do they both run Meshery on my local machine?\n\nAnswer: Yes, both of them do run Meshery on your local machine. `make server` builds Meshery from source and runs it on your local OS, while `mesheryctl system start` runs Meshery as a set of containers in Docker or in Kubernetes on your local machine.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What systems can I deploy Meshery onto?\n\nAnswer: Many. See Meshery's Compatibility Matrix.\n\n\n\nQuestion: What systems does Meshery manage?\nAnswer: Many. See Meshery's Integrations\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why is Meshery Server only receiving MeshSync updates from one of my Kubernetes Clusters?\nAnswer: In order to receive MeshSync updates, Meshery Server subscribes for updates Meshery Broker. In other words, Meshery Server connects to the `meshery-broker` service port in order to subscribe for streaming MeshSync updates. By default, the Meshery Broker service is deployed as type Kubernetes Service type LoadBalancer, which requires that your Kubernetes cluster provides an external IP address to the Meshery Broker service, exposing it external to the Kubernetes cluster.\nIf you're running Kubernetes in Docker Desktop, an external IP address of localhost is assigned. If you're running Minikube, and execute minikube tunnel to gain access to Meshery Broker's service, you will find that both Meshery Broker service endpoints (from two different clusters) are sharing the same localhost:4222 address and port number. This port sharing causes conflict and Meshery Server is only able to connect to one of the Meshery Brokers.\n\nFew ways to solve this problem:\n\n\nUse an external cloud provider which provides you with the LoadBalancer having an external IP address other than localhost.\nUse [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster with [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf) configuration\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why does the dashboard not show the infrastructure provisioned or discovered by Meshery?\nAnswer: This issue is typically caused by either lack of connectivity between Meshery Server and Meshery Broker or by database corruption. Use the following troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:\n\nLack of Connectivity\n\n\nConfirm that the Meshery Broker service is exposed from your cluster using kubectl get svc -n meshery and that an hostname or IP address is displayed in the External Address column. Meshery Server should be able to reach this address.\nIt is possible that MeshSync is not healthy and not sending cluster updates, check for MeshSync status by navigating to Settings in Meshery UI and clicking on the MeshSync connection.\nIf MeshSync is healthy, check the status of Meshery Broker by clicking on the NATS connection.\n\n\nIf either is the case, Meshery Operator will make sure MeshSync and Meshery Broker deployments are again healthy, wait for some time, otherwise try redeploying Meshery Operator.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Corruption\n\nIf MeshSync, Meshery Broker and Meshery Operator are healthy, then perhaps, there is corruption in the Meshery Database. Use the following troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:\n\n    Try clearing the database by clicking on the `Flush MeshSync` button associated with the corresponding cluster.\n    If still `Service Mesh` is not visible in UI, move on to `Hard Reset` of Database. This option is in the `Reset System` Tab in `Settings` page.\n\n\nNote: You can also verify health of your system using mesheryctl system check\n\n\nContributing FAQs\n\n\n\nQuestion: Getting an error while running make server on Windows?\nAnswer: On Windows, set up the project on Ubuntu WSL2 and you will be able to run the Meshery UI and the server. For more information please visit Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows.\n\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\nDon't find an answer to your question here? Ask on the Discussion Forum."

						"content": "Importing apps into Meshery as Meshery Apps is a powerful feature that enables users to manage, operate, and observe their service mesh more effectively. With this feature, users can easily import their app manifest and store it in the database.\n\nYou can import apps into Meshery using either the Meshery CLI or the Meshery UI. We will discuss both methods in detail below.\n\nUsing Meshery CLI:\n\nStep 1: Install Meshery CLI\n\nBefore you can use the Meshery CLI to import a Docker Compose app, you must first install it. You can install Meshery CLI by following the instructions on the Meshery documentation site.\n\nStep 2: Import the App Manifest\n\nOnce you have created your App Definition file, you can use the Meshery CLI to import your Docker Compose app into Meshery. To do this, run the following command:\n\n\nmesheryctl app import -f [file/url] -s [source-type]\n\n\nThis command enable users to import their existing applications from sources as\n\n  Helm Charts\n  Kubernetes Manifests\n  Docker Compose\n\n\nExample :\n\n\nmesheryctl app import -f ./SampleApplication.yml -s \"Kubernetes Manifest\"\n\n\nUsing Meshery UI:\n\nStep 1: Access the Meshery UI\n\nTo import a Docker Compose app into Meshery using the Meshery UI, you must first Install the Meshery. You can install Meshery by following the instructions on the Meshery documentation site\n\nStep 2: Navigate to the Application section in the Configuration\n\nOnce you have accessed the Meshery UI, navigate to the App Import page. This page can be accessed by clicking on the “Applications” menu item and then selecting “Import Application”.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Upload the Application\n\nOn the App Import page, you can upload your application by select File Type from the options and clicking on the “Browse” button and selecting the file from your local machine or uploading in through URL Once you have selected the file, click on the “Import” button to import app into Meshery.\nWhen you import a app into Meshery, it will create a Meshery App based on definition. This Meshery App will include all of the services, ports, and other parameters defined in the File.\n\n\n\nOnce the Meshery App has been created, you can use Meshery to manage, operate and observe your service mesh. You can also use Meshery to deploy your Meshery App to your service mesh."

						"content": "What are Meshery Adapters?\n\nPart of Meshery’s extensibility as a platform, Meshery Adapters are purpopse-built to address an area in need of management that is either considered optional to the platform and/or is considered an area in which additional depth of control is needed. Adapters extend Meshery’s management capabilities in any number of ways, including lifecycle, configuration, performance, governance, identity and so on. Meshery Adapters come in different form factors, and depending on their purpose, deliver different sets or capabilities. Each Adapter registers its capabilities with Meshery Server. Meshery Server, in-turn, exposes those capabilities for you to control.\n\nMeshery Adapters for Lifecycle Management\n\nAdapters that extend Meshery’s lifecycle management capabilities for infrastructure do so, by offering an infrastructure-specific interface to increase the depth of control that Meshery has over a particular technology. Meshery uses adapters to offer choice of load generator (for performance management) and for managing different layers of your infrastructure. Lifecycle adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure, exposing their differentiated value to users.\n\nMeshery has lifecycle adapters for managing the following cloud native infrastructure.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Adapter Status\n      Adapter\n      Port\n      Earliest Version supported\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Consul\n      10002/gRPC\n      v1.8.4\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Cilium Service Mesh\n      10012/gRPC\n      v1.10.6\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Traefik Mesh\n      10006/gRPC\n      v1.0\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh\n      10009/gRPC\n      v0.9.2\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Network Service Mesh\n      10004/gRPC\n      v0.2.1\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for NGINX Service Mesh\n      10010/gRPC\n      v1.2.0\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Linkerd\n      10001/gRPC\n      v2.10.2\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Kuma\n      10007/gRPC\n      v1.2.2\n    \n    \n      stable\n       Meshery Adapter for Istio\n      10000/gRPC\n      v1.6.0\n    \n    \n      beta\n       Meshery Adapter for App Mesh\n      10005/gRPC\n      v1.4.1\n    \n    \n      alpha\n       Meshery Adapter for Tanzu Service Mesh\n      10011/gRPC\n      pre-GA\n    \n  \n\n\nMeshery Adapters for Performance Management\n\nv0.8.0 Roadmap: The meshery-perf adapter externalizes Nighthawk as an Meshery component.\n\nMeshery Server allows users to generate traffic load tests using Nighthawk, fortio, and wrk2. Using the meshery-perf adapter, you can schedule, control, and execute performance tests.\n\nRun the meshery-perf adapter as an externalized load generator when you:\n\n\n  Need a smaller sized container image for Meshery. Nighthawk binaries are dynamically linked (C++) and they need other dependencies to work. This causes bloat in Meshery Server’s image which doesn’t need them.\n  Need adaptive load control of your performance tests, controlling the variability by which the system under test receives load. Use Meshery Server to run adaptive load tests.\n  Need distributed load testing and the ability to horizontally scale Nighthawk, using Nighthawk’s execution forwarding service and results sink.\n\n\nAdapter Deployment and Registration\n\nLike every Meshery component, Meshery Adapters use MeshKit.\n\nAdapter FAQs\n\nIs each Meshery adapter made equal?\n\nNo, different Meshery adapters are written to expose the unique value of each cloud native infrastructure. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each cloud native infrastructure is not equally capable as the other. Each Adapter has a set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types. See the extensibility page for more details on adapter operations.\n\nHow can I create a new adapter?\n\nYes, see the extensibility documentation for details how to create a new Meshery Adapter. See the Meshery Adapter Template repository as boilerplate for your new adapter.\n\nDo adapters have to be written in Golang?\n\nNo. Adapters much interface with Meshery Server via gRPC. What language is used in that adapter is the perogative of a given adapter’s maintainers.\n\nCan I run more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter?\n\nYes. The default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the meshery-istio adapter. To do so, modify ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml to include multiple copies of the given adapter.\n\nSee the “Multiple Adapters” guide for more information."

						"content": "Guiding Principles of Adapter Design\n\nAdapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure. Review the list of all available Meshery Adapters. See the Meshery Architecture diagrams for visuals on how adapters relate to other Meshery components.\n\nMeshery upholds the following guiding principles for adapter design:\n\n\n  Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different cloud native infrastructure, exposing their differentiated value to users.\n    \n      Cloud native infrastructure projects should be encouraged to maintain their own adapters. Allowing them to expose their differentiated capabilities encourages this.\n    \n  \n  Adapters should avoid wheel reinvention, but seek to leverage the functionality provided by cloud native infrastructure under management.\n    \n      This both reduces sustaining costs and improves reliability.\n    \n  \n\n\nAdapter Capabilities\n\nMeshery communicates with adapters over gRPC. Adapters establish communication with the cloud native infrastructure. Adapters have a predefined set of operations which are grouped based on predefined operation types.\n\nThe predefined operation types are:\n\n\n  Install\n  Sample application\n  Config\n  Validate\n  Custom\n\n\nMeshery Adapter Codebase Overview\n\nCommon libraries are used to avoid code duplication and apply DRY.\n\nMeshKit\n\nThe code hierarchy is pluggable and independent from one another. There can be N number of packages depending upon the use case.\n\n  errors/ - holds the implementations and the error handlers and error codes which are used across projects.\n  logger/ - holds the implementations of logging handler and custom attributes to add if any.\n  utils/ - holds all the utility functions that are specific to meshery projects and are to be used generically across all of them.\n  tracing/ - holds the implementations of tracing handlers with different tracing providers like jaeger,newrelic, etc.\n\n\nEach package inside a meshkit is a handler interface implementation, the implementation could be from any third-party packages or the go-kit.\n\nMeshery Adapter Library\n\nThis section contains a high level overview of the meshery-adapter-library, its purpose and architecture. For details, the reader is referred to the documentation and the code in the repository.\n\nThe main purpose of the meshery-adapter-library is to:\n\n  provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.\n  implement common cross cutting concerns like logging, errors, and tracing\n  provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and - operations implemented in the adapters.\n  provide middleware extension points\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Displaying Meshery Adapter library architecture along with an example of integration\n\nOverview and Usage\n\nThe library consists of interfaces and default implementations for the main and common functionality of an adapter. It also provides a mini-framework that runs the gRPC adapter service, calling the functions of handlers injected by the adapter code. This is represented in an UML-ish style in the figure below. The library is used in all of Meshery’s adapters."

						"title": "Extensibility: APIs",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /extensibility/api",
						"content": "Meshery’s APIs\n\nEach of Meshery’s APIs are subject to the following authentication and authorization system. The REST and GraphQL APIs are available on the same network port you use to connect to Meshery UI, which is 9081/tcp by default. Each of the API endpoints are exposed through server.go. Endpoints are grouped by function (e.g. /api/system/version). Additionally, Remote Providers can extend Meshery’s endpoints behind the /api/extensions/ endpoint.\n\nAuthentication\n\nRequests to any of the API endpoints must be authenticated and include a valid JWT access token in the HTTP headers. Type of authentication is determined by the selected Provider. Use of the Local Provider, “None”, puts Meshery into single-user mode and does not require authentication.\n\n\nWhat are authentication tokens?\nMeshery authentication tokens allow users or systems to authenticate with Meshery Server via either its two clients, Meshery &gt;CLI and UI, or its two APIs: REST or GraphQL. Meshery's authentication token system provide secure access to Meshery's powerful management features.\n\n\nHow to get your token\n\nThere are two ways to get your authentication token:\n\n\n  Meshery UI\n  Meshery CLI\n\n\nUsing Meshery UI, you can get a copy of your authentication token by following these steps:\n\n\n  Log into Meshery by selecting your identity provider of choice (typically found at http:&lt;meshery-server&gt;:9081/provider)\n  Navigate to your user’s avatar in the upper lefthand corner and select “Get Token” from the dropdown of profile section.\n\n\nUsing Meshery CLI, you can get a copy of your authentication token by executing this command:\n\n\n\nmesheryctl system login\n\n\n\nIn order to use this command, you must have a web browser available on your system (this command cannot be executed on a headless system).\n\n\nHow to use the token for requests to Meshery Rest API using API clients\n Download your token from Meshery UI and copy the token value from the downloaded file, this will be used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\nmeshery-provider: Meshery\ntoken: your token\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the cookies section your API testing platform, to set the appropriate name and value for the cookie, then make sure to save the configured cookies to initiate the request.  The request will be sent to the Meshery API using the configured cookies for authentication\n\n\nEndpoints\n\nEach of the API endpoints are exposed through server.go. Endpoints are grouped by function (e.g. /api/mesh or /api/perf).\n\nAlternatively, Remote Providers can extend Meshery’s endpoints behind the /api/extensions/ endpoint.\n\nAuthorization\n\nWhile Meshery only requires a valid token in order to allow clients to invoke its APIs, Remote Providers can optionally enforce key-based permissions.\n\nAPIs\n\n  \n\nREST API\n\n\nGraphQL API\n\n\nMeshery Server's REST API is available at [hostname]:[port]/api/.\n\n\nMeshery's REST API Reference\nSee REST API Reference Self-generated API documentation for Meshery’s REST API. Documentation is generated from Meshery’s Open API schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeshery Server's GraphQl API is available at {hostname]:[port]/api/graphql/query. A GraphQL request can be made as a POST request to the endpoint with the query as the payload. Meshery Server's GraphQL API can be used to perform three operations:\n\n\n  Queries for data retrieval.\n  Mutations for creating, updating, and deleting data.\n   Subscriptions for watching for any data changes.\n\n\nExplore the Meshery GraphQL API using the interactive Playground provided with Meshery instance at http://localhost:9081/api/system/graphql/playground.\n\n\nMeshery's GraphQL API Reference\nSee GraphQL API Reference Self-generated API documentation for Meshery’s GraphQL API. The API can be explored interactively using the GraphQL Playground. Documentation is generated from Meshery’s GraphQL schema. Each table below documents a GraphQL type.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n  Extension Points"

						"content": "Components, their Purpose, and Languages\n\nMeshery and its components are written using the following languages and technologies.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Components\n      Languages and Technologies\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Meshery Server\n      Golang, gRPC, GraphQL, SMP\n    \n    \n      Meshery Adapters\n      Golang, gRPC, CloudEvents, SMI, OAM\n    \n    \n      Meshery WASM Filters\n      Rust and C++\n    \n    \n      Meshery UI\n      ReactJS, NextJS, BillboardJS\n    \n    \n      Meshery Provider UI\n      ReactJS, NextJS\n    \n    \n      Meshery Remote Providers\n      any - must adhere to Meshery Extension Points\n    \n    \n      Meshery Operator\n      Golang\n    \n    \n           MeshSync\n      Golang\n    \n    \n           Broker\n      Golang, NATS\n    \n    \n      Meshery Database\n      Golang, SQLlite\n    \n  \n\n\nDeployments\n\nMeshery deploys as a set of containers. Meshery’s containers can be deployed to either Docker or Kubernetes. Meshery components connect to one another via gRPC requests. Meshery Server stores the location of the other components and connects with those components as needed. Typically, a connection from Meshery Server to Meshery Adapters is initiated from a client request (usually either mesheryctl or Meshery UI) to gather information from the Adapter or invoke an Adapter’s operation.\n\nAdapters\n\nIn Meshery v0.6.0, Adapters will register with Meshery Server over HTTP POST. If Meshery Server is not available, Meshery Adapters will backoff and retry to connect to Meshery Server perpetually.\n\n\n\nFigure: Meshery deploys inside or outside of a Kubernetes cluster\n\nAdapters and Capabilities Registry\n\nEach Meshery Adapter delivers its own unique specific functionality. As such, at time of deployment, the Meshery Adapter will register its cloud native infrastructure-specific capabilities (its operations) with Meshery Server’s capability registry.\n\n\n\nFigure: Meshery Adapter Operation Registration\n\nClients\n\nMeshery’s REST API may be consumed by any number of clients. Clients need to present valid JWT token.\n\n\n\nFigure: Clients use Meshery’s REST API, GraphQL API, or a combination of both.\n\nProviders\n\nAs a point of extension, Meshery supports two types of providers: Local and Remote.\n\n\n\nObject Model\n\nThis diagram outlines logical constructs within Meshery and their relationships.\n\n\n\nMeshery Operator and MeshSync\n\nMeshery Operator is the multi-cluster Kubernetes operator that manages MeshSync and Meshery Broker.\n\n\n\nSee the Operator section for more information on the function of an operator and MeshSync section for more information on the function of meshsync.\n\nDatabase\n\nMeshery Server’s database is responsible for collecting and centralizing the state of all elements under management, including infrastructure, application, and Meshery’s own components. Meshery’s database, while persisted to file, is treated as a cache.\n\n\n\nSee the Database section for more information on the function of the database.\n\nMeshery Docker Extension\n\nMeshery’s Docker extension provides a simple and flexible way to design and operate cloud native infrastructure on top of Kubernetes using Docker containers. The architecture of this extension is designed to be modular and extensible, with each component serving a specific purpose within the overall deployment process.\n\n\n\nStatefulness in Meshery components\n\nSome components within Meshery’s architecture are concerned with persisting data while others are only\nconcerned with a long-lived configuration, while others have no state at all.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Components\n      Persistence\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      mesheryctl\n      stateless\n      command line interface that has a configuration file\n    \n    \n      Meshery Adapters\n      stateless\n      interface with cloud native infrastructure on a transactional basis\n    \n    \n      Meshery Server\n      caches state\n      application cache is stored in $HOME/.meshery/ folder\n    \n    \n      Meshery Providers\n      stateful\n      location of persistent user preferences, environment, tests and so on\n    \n    \n      Meshery Operator\n      stateless\n      operator of Meshery custom controllers, notably MeshSync\n    \n    \n      MeshSync\n      stateless\n      Kubernetes custom controller, continuously running discovery\n    \n  \n\n\nNetwork Ports\n\nMeshery uses the following list of network ports to interface with its various components:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Component\n      Port\n      Purpose\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Meshery Server\n      9081/tcp\n      UI, REST and GraphQL APIs\n    \n    \n      Meshery Server\n      80/tcp\n      Websocket\n    \n    \n      Meshery Broker\n      4222/tcp\n      Client communication with Meshery Server\n    \n    \n      Meshery Broker\n      8222/tcp\n      HTTP management port for monitoring Meshery Broker.

						"content": "Broker is a custom Kubernetes controller that provides data streaming across independent components of Meshery whether those components are running inside or outside of the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nBroker FAQs\n\nHow many Brokers can run?\nIt is recommended to run one broker instance for each kubernetes cluster, However the instance itself can be scaled up based on the incoming data volume in each of the cluster. The scaling is independent of the number of instances running.\n\nWhat does an HA configuration look like?\nWe leverage on the kubernetes functionality in terms of the High-Availability behaviour. Meaning, the broker instance gets instantiated/restarted on its own when an issue occurs. In part, Meshery-Operator is also responsible for keeping the broker functional.\n\nWhat stateful characteristics does the Broker have?\nAll the messages that are published to the broker is persisted in-memory within the broker instance until it get consumed. Persistent-volume/Disk-space is not currently being used by the Broker.\n\nHow do I know if the Broker is working? How do I troubleshoot the Broker?\nThe Broker instance is deployed inside the kubernetes cluster as a Statefulset. In the case where the broker doesn’t seem to work, here are a few steps to troubleshoot the instance:\n\n\n  Make sure the pods corresponding to the Statefulset is up and running.\n  Make sure the kubernetes cluster has support for kubernetes Service type LoadBalancer or NodePort.\n  Ensure connectivity between the Meshery-Server and the Broker service endpoint."

Meshery adapters are out-of-process adapters (meaning not compiled into the main Meshery binary), and as such, are independent build artifacts and Helm charts. The Docker images are created and tagged with the git commit SHA, then pushed to Docker Hub automatically using GitHub Actions. Subsequently, when contributions containing content for the Helm charts of Meshery and Meshery Adapter are linted and merged, they will be pushed and released to meshery.io Github page by GitHub Action automatically.\n\nArtifact Repositories\n\nArtifacts produced in the build processes are published and persisted in different public repositories and in different formats.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Location\n      Project\n      Repository\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Docker Hub\n      Meshery\n      https://hub.docker.com/r/layer5/meshery\n    \n    \n      GitHub\n      mesheryctl\n      https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases\n    \n    \n      Docker Hub\n      Meshery Adapter for &lt;service-mesh&gt;\n      https://hub.docker.com/r/layer5/meshery-&lt;service-mesh&gt;\n    \n    \n      Docs\n      Meshery Documentation\n      https://docs.meshery.io\n    \n    \n      GitHub\n      Service Mesh Performance\n      https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance\n    \n    \n      Github\n      Helm charts\n      https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/tree/master/charts\n    \n  \n\n\nSecrets\n\nSome portions of the workflow require secrets to accomplish their tasks. These secrets are defined within the respective repositories and accessible to workflows during runtime. Currently defined secrets include:\n\n\n  DOCKER_USERNAME: Username of the Docker Hub user with the right privileges to push images\n  DOCKER_PASSWORD: Password for the Docker Hub user\n  GO_VERSION: As of July 21st 2021 it is 1.16\n  IMAGE_NAME: appropriate image name for each of the Docker container images. All are under the layer5io org.\n  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: Used for notification of new GitHub stars given to the Meshery repo.\n  CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: Used for integration with the Layer5 account on Cypress.\n  GLOBAL_TOKEN: Used for securely transmitting performance test results for the None Provider.\n\n\nThe Docker Hub user, mesheryci, belongs to the “ciusers” team in Docker Hub and acts as the service account under which these automated builds are being pushed. Every time a new Docker Hub repository is created we have to grant “Admin” (in order to update the README in the Docker Hub repository) permissions to the ciusers team.\n\nChecks and Tests\n\nMeshery’s CI workflow incorporates several checks (partial list below) during merges and/or commits to any branches and pull requests to master branch to prevent broken code from being merged into master.\n\nCollectively, Meshery repositories will generally have CI workflow for commits and pull requests that consist of the following actions:\n\n\n  Lint check (golint)\n  Static analysis check (staticcheck)\n  Vet (govet)\n  Security checks (gosec)\n  Unit tests (go tests)\n  Build (go build)\n  Release binaries through GoReleaser (only for mesheryctl in the Meshery repository)\n  Docker build, tag and push\n  Helm charts lint (helm)\n  Helm charts release, tag and push(stefanprodan/helm-gh-pages@master)\n\n\nTests for adapters\n\nAll Meshery adapters use a central workflow that is referenced in each of their test workflows which get triggered every time a pull request is made. These\ntests in adapters are end-to-end tests and use patternfile. The reusable workflow is present in .github/workflows in Meshery repository with the workflow name “Test for Meshery adapters using patternfile”\n\nPre-requisite for referencing this workflow\n\n\n  Using actions/upload-artifact@v2 a patternfile has to be uploaded as an artifact with the name as “patternfile”.\n  The name of the uploaded patterfile should be passed in\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n      patternfile_name: &lt; name of the patternfile which is uploaded &gt;\n\n\n\n  Note: This Job is pre-run to the actual test. This is done in order to create patternfiles dynamically and use them. Therefore name of this jobs has to be passed as\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  needs:\n     &lt; Name of the pre-requisite job &gt;\n\n\n\n  There should be an infinite token passed in: (Or else local provider will be used)\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  secrets:\n    token: $\n\n\nFunctionality of Central Workflow\n\n\n  Checks out the code of the repository(on the ref of latest commit of branch which made the PR) in which it is referenced.\n  Starts a minikube cluster\n  Builds a docker image of the adapter and sets minikube to use docker’s registry.\n  Starts the adapter and meshery server (The url to deployment and service yaml of adapter are configurable).\nNOTE: The service mesh name( whose adapter we are testing ) has to passed in:\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n     adapter_name: &lt; NAME OF THE SERVICE MESH &gt;\n\n\n\n  The uploaded patternfile is deployed.\n  Workflow sleeps for some time.\n  Then the assertion is made that the pods passed in-\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n     expected_pods: &lt; pod1,pod2,pod3 &gt;  #comma separated pod names that will be expected to be present after patternfile is deployed\n\n\n\n  And these pods are present in their respective namespaces passed in-\n\n\n\n\n  ...\n  with:\n     expected_pods_namespaces: &lt; pod1ns, pod2ns , pod3ns &gt;\n\n\nExpected inputs of this workflow\n\n\n\ninputs:\n  expected_pods:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  expected_pods_namespaces:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  service_url:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  deployment_url:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  adapter_name:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  patternfile_name:\n    required: true\n    type: string\n  provider:\n    required: false\n    type: string\nsecrets:\n  token:\n\n\nExpected outputs of this workflow\n\nThe pods passed in “expected_pods” are running in the subsequent namespaces passed in “expected_pods_namespaces”. If not, the workflow fails\n\nAutomated Builds\n\nAll Meshery GitHub repositories are configured with GitHub Actions. Everytime a pull request is submitted against the master branch of any repository, that repository’s GitHub Actions will be invoked (whether the PR is merged or not). Workflows defined in Meshery repository will generally (but not always) perform the following actions:\n\n\n  trigger a Docker build to build a Docker container image\n  generate two Docker tags:\n    \n      a tag containing the git merge SHA\n      a tag containing that particular release’s git tag (if one is present)\n    \n  \n  assign each of these two tags to the new container image as well as the latest tag.\n  push the new Docker tags and image to Docker Hub.\n\n\nBuilding mesheryctl\n\nAs a special case, the meshery repository contains an additional artifact produced during each build. This artifact is mesheryctl which is built as an executable binary. In order to make the job of building mesheryctl easier for a combination of different platform architectures and operating systems, we are using GoReleaser. Irrespective of branch, for every git commit and git push to the meshery repository, GoReleaser will execute and generate the OS and arch-specific binaries ( but will NOT publish them to GitHub). Even though mesheryctl binaries are built each time a pull request is merged to master, only stable channel artifacts are published (persisted).\n\nReleasing mesheryctl to GitHub\n\nOnly when a git tag containing a semantic version number is present (is a commit in the master branch) will GoReleaser execute, generate the archives, and also publish the archives to Meshery’s GitHub releases automatically. GoReleaser is configured to generate artifacts for the following OS, ARCH combination:\n\n\n  Darwin - i386, x86_64\n  Linux - i386, x86_64\n  Windows - i386, x86_64\n  FreeBSD - i386, x86_64\n\n\nThe artifacts will be made available as a tar.gz archive for all the operating systems. mesheryctl is bundled into packages for commonly used package managers: homebrew and scoop.\n\nHomebrew\n\nGoReleaser facilitates the creation of a brew formula for mesheryctl. The homebrew-tap repository is the location for Layer5’s brew formulas.\n\nScoop\n\nGoReleaser facilitates the creation of a Scoop app for mesheryctl. The scoop-bucket repository is the location of Layer5’s Scoop bucket.\n\nHelm Charts Lint Check, Build, and Release\n\nThe charts lint check, charts build, and charts release workflows are all triggered by GitHub events. Sometimes this event is the opening, updating, or merging of a branch, or sometimes a manual invocation, or a GitHub release event.\n\nCheck Helm Charts\n\nEvery PR which includes changes to the files under install/kubernetes/ directory in the meshery/meshery will trigger a Github Action to check for any mistakes in Helm charts using the helm lint command.\n\nRelease Helm Charts to Github and Artifact Hub\n\nNew Meshery Helm charts are published upon trigger of a release event in the meshery/meshery repo. New versions of Meshery’s Helm charts are published to Meshery’s Helm charts release page. [Artifact Hub] (https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/meshery/meshery) syncs with these updated Meshery Helm charts.\n\nRelease Versioning\n\nMeshery and its components follow the commonly used, semantic versioning for its release numbering scheme. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD, increment the:\n\n\n  MAJOR version - major changes with rare potential for incompatible API changes.\n  MINOR version - add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.\n  PATCH version - mostly for bug and security fixes.\n  AlPHA/BETA/RC - used to facilitate early testing of an upcoming release.\n\n\nComponent Versioning\n\nMeshery comprises a number of components including a server, adapters, UI, and CLI. As an application, Meshery is a composition of these different functional components. While all of Meshery’s components generally deploy as a collective unit (together), each component is versioned independently, so as to allow them to be loosely coupled and iterate on functionality independently. Some of the components must be upgraded simultaneously, while others may be upgraded independently. See Upgrading Meshery for more information.\n\nGitHub release tags will contain a semantic version number. Semantic version numbers will have to be managed manually by tagging a relevant commit in the master branch with a semantic version number (example: v1.2.3).\n\nRelease Process\n\nDocumentation of Meshery releases contains a table of releases and release notes and should be updated with each release.\n\nAutomated Releases\n\nReleases are manually triggered by a member of the release team publishing a release. Release names and release tags need to be assigned by the publishing team member. GitHub Action workflows will trigger and take care of running the required steps and publishing all artifacts (e.g., binary and docker images).\n\nWorkflow Triggers\n\nThe following events will trigger one or more workflows:\n\n\n  Tagged Release\n  Commit pushed to the master branch\n  PR opened or commit pushed to PR branch\n  PR merged to the master branch\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\nWhile use of GitHub Actions facilitates automated builds, ReleaseDrafter is helping with facilitating automated release notes and versioning.\n\nGenerating Release Notes\n\nReleaseDrafter generates a GitHub tag and release draft. ReleaseDrafter action will trigger and will automatically draft release notes according to the configuration set-up. ReleaseDrafter drafts releases as soon as a commit is made into master after the previous release. The GitHub Action, ReleaseDrafter, is compatible with semantic releases and is used to auto-increment the semantic version number by looking at the previous release version.\n\nAutomated Release Notes Publishing\n\nThe publishing of release notes to Meshery Docs is automated. Triggered by a release event, a workflow will checkout the Meshery repo, copy the auto-drafted release notes into a Jekyll collection in Meshery Docs, and generate a pull request.\n\nAutomated Release Notes Sending\n\nThe sending of release notes is now automated as a step in the stable release channel workflow. The release notes are automatically sent to the developers@meshery.io mailing list.\n\nAutomated Pull Request Labeler\n\nA GitHub Issue labeler bot is configured to automatically assign labels to issues based on which files have changed in which directories. For example, a pull request with changes to files in the “/docs/**” folder will receive the “area/docs” label. Presence of the “area/docs” label is used to trigger documentation builds and Netlify builds of the Meshery Docs. Similar labels are assigned and used to trigger workflows or used as conditional flags in workflows to determine which workflows or which steps in a workflows to run.\n\nRelease Channels\n\nArtifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels.\n\nRelative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n\nStable Channel\n\nThe following is an example of the release channels and the docker tags used to differentiate them. The latest tag will be applied only to images in the stable release channel. Here are two releases with two different images.\n\nLatest Stable Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:stable-latest\n  layer5/meshery:stable-v0.4.1\n  layer5/meshery:stable-324vdgb (sha)\n\n\nOlder Stable Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:stable-v0.4.0\n  layer5/meshery:stable-289d02 (sha)\n\n\nEvery docker image built receives either the edge tags or the stable tags. Which set of image tags assigned is determined by whether a release tag is present or not. In other words, stable channel docker images get the “stable” tags only in the presence of a release tag (e.g. v0.4.1).\n\nEdge Channel\n\nThe Edge release channel provides early access to the latest features, allowing experimentation and feedback. Recent updates introduce dynamic versioning for Edge releases and improve compatibility with remote providers, ensuring a seamless experience. This makes the Edge channel valuable for users seeking cutting-edge features while contributing to the Meshery project. Docker image tags remain consistent for differentiation.\n\nStable and edge releases are both published to the same Docker Hub repository. Docker Hub repositories differentiate release channels by image tag. The following Docker images tagging convention is followed:\n\nLatest Edge Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:edge-latest\n  layer5/meshery:edge-289d02 (sha)\n\n\nOlder Edge Image\n\n\n  layer5/meshery:edge-324vdgb (sha)\n\n\nSwitching Between Meshery Release Channels\n\nUsers are empowered to switch between release channels at their leisure.\n\nSwitching Release Channels Using mesheryctl\n\nUsers can use mesheryctl to switch between release channels, e.g. mesheryctl system channel [stable|edge]. Alternatively, users can manually switch between channels by updating the docker image tags in their meshery.yaml / Kubernetes manifest files. This command generates a meshery.yml (a docker-compose file) with release channel-appropriate tags for the different Docker container images.\n\nViewing Release Channel and Version Information in Meshery UI\n\nUsers are shown their Meshery deployment’s release channel subscription enient new setting in the Preferences area of the Meshery UI, so that people can alternatively use the UI to switch between channels if they like. Version numbers for Meshery adapters are also shown in the UI.\n\nRelease Cadence\n\nMinor releases of the Meshery project are release frequently (on a monthly basis on average) with patch releases made on-demand in-between those times. The project does not have long term releases that are sustained with bug fixes, yet. Bug fixes and patches will be released as needed on the latest release version.\n\nRelease Support\n\nGeneral community support and commercial support from Layer5 is available. Separately, third parties and partners may offer longer-term support solutions.\n\nPre v1.0\n\nProject focuses on functionality, quality and adoption, while retaining the flexibility for shifts in architecture.\n\nPost v1.0\n\nOnce a 1.0 release has been made, Around once a month or so, the project maintainers will take one of these daily builds and run it through a number of additional qualification tests and tag the build as a Stable release. Around once a quarter or so, the project maintainers take one of these Stable releases, run through a bunch more tests and tag the build as a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Finally, if we find something wrong with an LTS release, we issue patches.\n\nThe different types (Daily, Stable, LTS) represent different product quality levels and different levels of support from the Meshery team. In this context, support means that we will produce patch releases for critical issues and offer technical assistance.\n\nVersioning Documentation\n\nFor new major release\n\nThe structure which the docs follow right now is, The main docs folder has the most recent version of documentation, while there are sub-folders for previous versions, v0.x (x being the last major release).\nOn release of a new major version, the static html files for the most recent version is generated and is renamed as the release version (v0.x).\n\nSteps:\n\nAfter cloning the Meshery repository\n\n\n  cd docs &gt; bundle install &gt; make docs\n  On executing make docs a _site folder is created which has static html files.\n  The _site folder is renamed to v0.x.\n  This v0.x folder is now the latest version of docs.\n\n\nIn the v0.x folder\n\n\n  Search and replace all the instances where there is a direct path is defined to include the version name in the path, i.e, all paths to intra-page links and images should start with /v0.x/.\n\n\n\n  Look for href=\"/ and replace with href=\"/0.x/\n  Look for src=\"/and replace with src=\"/0.x/ \n\n\n\n\n\nFor old release\n\nFor older releases we have to travel back in time. Using the Tags in github we go to a previous release, v0.X.x, the .x here should be the latest version of the archived docs.\n\nSteps:\n\n\n  \n    Copy the commit ID for that release. \n\n\n\n  \n  git checkout &lt;commit ID&gt; &gt; cd docs &gt; bundle install &gt; make docs\n  On executing make docs a _site folder is created which has static html files.\n  The _site folder is renamed to v0.X and is copied into the docs folder of the present version.\n\n\nBi-Weekly Meetings\n\nIf you are passionate about CI/CD pipelines, DevOps, automated testing, managing deployments, or if you want to learn how to use Meshery and its features, you are invited to join the bi-weekly Build and Release meetings. Find meeting details and agenda in the community calendar and the meeting minutes document. The meetings are open to everyone and recorded for later viewing. We hope to see you there!\n\nThese steps for replacing all the instances of direct path are to be followed."

						"content": "As an cloud native management platform, Meshery has built-in support infastructure and application configuration management. Use Meshery to configure your multi-cluster Kubernetes environments on-premises or across clouds.\n\nWhat is a Meshery Design?\n\nMeshery’s core construct of configuration management is that of a design. A design is ultimately a document – and a document in which you capture and describe your desired state of improv the environment.\n\nCreating a Meshery Design\n\nyou have your choice of how are you would like to create an infrastructure design. You can use the design configurator inside of measure, UI or extensions, like MeshMap, or you can hand code your design, using the mesh model spec, if you like.\n\nUse Meshery UI or mesheryctl to manage designs.\n\nPattern Management Through Meshery UI\n\nMeshery also comes with seed patterns when users start Meshery for the first time. These patterns cover common use cases and examples for you as you explore Meshery.\n\n\n\nUsers can also import these patterns to their remote provider from this sample repository.\n\n\n\nOnce these patterns are imported, you can then edit these patterns or use the pattern configurator to configure them according to your requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern Management Through Meshery CLI\n\nYou can also manage service mesh patterns through Meshery’s CLI, mesheryctl.\n\nThe mesheryctl pattern subcommand lets you import and apply patterns to your cluster.\n\nFor example, if you have your pattern written in a file say, istio-bookinfo.yaml which deploys Istio service mesh and onboards the BookInfo app on Istio, you can use mesheryctl to apply this pattern as shown below:\n\nmesheryctl pattern apply -f istio-bookinfo.yaml\n\n\nIf you already have a pattern imported into Meshery, you can apply the pattern by name.\n\nmesheryctl pattern apply BookInfoApp\n\n\nThis will apply the pattern BookInfoApp, which has already been imported into Meshery.\n\nSee mesheryctl pattern subcommand section for more details on the pattern subcommand.\n\nWASM Filters\n\nMeshery can be used for managing WebAssembly Filters through the UI or the CLI.\n\nFilter Management Through Meshery UI\n\nLike patterns, Meshery also comes with some sample WebAssembly Filters for you to experiment.\n\n\n\nYou can also import these filters manually to your provider from the wasm-filters repo.\n\nMeshery’s sample application ImageHub will let you test out configuring these filters out-of-the-box.\n\nYou can onboard ImageHub to an installed service mesh as shown below.\n\n\n\nFilter Management Through Meshery CLI\n\nYou can also manage WASM filters through Meshery’s CLI, mesheryctl.\n\nThe mesheryctl exp filter subcommand lets you import and configure filters in your service meshes.\n\nFor example,\n\nmesheryctl exp filter apply -f metrics_collector_bg.wasm\n\n\nIf you already have a filter imported into Meshery, you can configure the filter by name.\n\nmesheryctl exp filter apply metrics_collector_bg\n\n\nApplications\n\nMeshery can also manage your Kubernetes applications and can onboard/offboard them of deployed service meshes.\n\nManaging Applications Through Meshery UI\n\nMeshery has a set of sample applications which you can use to quickly test out your deployment.\n\n\n\nYou can also bring in your own applications by uploading it from filesystem or importing it from a URL.\n\n\n\nThe application files can be described in Kubernetes manifest format or pattern format.\n\nYou can also run the same application on different service meshes and compare the performance. See Performance Management with Meshery for more details.\n\nManaging Applications Through Meshery CLI\n\nThe mesheryctl app subcommand lets you manage your custom application workloads with Meshery.\n\nYou can onboard/offboard applications from your mesh as shown in the example below.\n\nmesheryctl app onboard imagehub.yaml\n\n\nmesheryctl app offboard imagehub.yaml"

						"content": "States and the Lifecycle of Connections\n\nEvery connection can be in one of the below mentioned states at any given point of time. To better understand these states, consider you have a Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus already installed.\n\n1. Discovered\n\nAll resources discovered by MeshSync’s multi-tier discovery or provided as part of config, and if Meshery can integrate, a connection with state as Discovered will be created. Though, the connection/resources are not tested for its reachability/usability i.e. Meshery has not made an attempt to connect or manage the connection.\n\nWhen a connection has been discovered, it will be listed in the MeshSync browser / Connections table in Meshery UI. You can self transition a particular connection to Register / Ignore state.\n\n\n  Eg: MeshSync discovers Prometheus components and inform Meshery Server about available Prometheus connection, but Meshery is yet to connect and start scraping metrics.\n\n\n2. Registered\n\nThe connection in this state have been verified for its use and reachability but not yet being used. Almost all reachable connections will auto transition to Registered state from Discovered state and it is upto the user what to do with this connection (i.e. User needs to administratively process the connection). It can be transitioned to Connected, Maintenance and Not Found.\n\n\n  Eg: User manually selects the registered Prometheus connection and transition to the connected state (i.e. User administratively processes the connection).\n\n\n3. Connected\n\nThe connection in this state is administratively processed and being actively managed by Meshery. User can interface and invoke set of actions with the connection.&lt;/br&gt;\nFrom this state the transition can happen to either Maintenance or Ignore state. &lt;/br&gt; Auto transition to Disconnected state will occur if Meshery can no longer communicate with the connection, which can occur due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside Meshery or any other issue.\n\n\n  Eg: Meshery is communicating with Prometheus APIs to scrape metrics and present it in the UI.\n\n\nCertain connections can auto transition to connected state.\n\n4. Ignored:\n\nThe connection is administratively processed to be ignored from Meshery’s view of management. Meshery will not re-discover this connection even when current user session gets expired.\n\n\n  Eg: Meshery server will stop/not scrape metrics from Prometheus. Though, the previous data (if connected previously) will continue to exist and user needs to manually delete.\n\n\n5. Maintenance:\n\nThe connection is administratively processed to be offline for maintenance tasks. This is different from being Disconnected/Ignored.\n\n6. Disconnected:\n\nThe connection was previously discovered/registered/connected but is not available currently. This could happen due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside meshery/administratively disconnected.\n\n\n  Eg: Prometheus crashed/API token provided at time of registration is revoked.\n\n\n7. Deleted:\n\nThe connection is administratively processed to be deleted and removed from Meshery’s view of management. All the available/collected data will also be deleted.\n\n\n  Eg: Prometheus metrics will no longer be accessible to you from the Meshery UI.\n\n\n8. Not Found:\n\nUser tried registering the connection manually but Meshery could not connect to it or if the connection is unavailable now. User can delete the connection or try re-registering.\n\nIgnored vs Disconnected\n\nA user intentionally chooses to have Meshery ignore a given Prometheus, explicitly leaving in Meshery’s field of view, but identifying it as a connection not to manage. This is distinctly different than a Prometheus that Meshery was managing, but has been turned off/uninstalled and now Meshery is disconnected from the Prometheus.\n\nNot Found vs Disconnected\n\nA user manually tried to transition to Connected state but the connection is unavaialble now due to being deleted/some other reason. This is distinctly different than a cluster with Prometheuses installed for application monitoring which was connected previously but is now unreachable from Meshery’s view of management due to change in API token/similar issue.\n\nDisconnected vs Deleted\n\nThe connection was previously connected but is unreachable due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside Meshery i.e. Connection was deleted beyond the Meshery’s view of management.\n\nConnections like Registration of Meshery server with remote provider (and few other connection types) can self transtion to the valid states."

						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-adapters",
						"content": "Meshery Adapters are the Extension Points in Meshery’s architecture. Their design, the process of creating a new adapter is documented in Extensibility: Meshery Adapters.\n\nWith the CONTRIBUTING.md in mind, understand that development follows the usual fork-and-pull request workflow described here, see also GitHub Process. On forking GitHub deactivates all workflows. It is safe and good practice to activate them such that the code is validated on each push. This requires that branches filter for “on push” is set to ‘**’ to be triggered also on branches containing ‘/’  in their name.  The actions are parameterized using secrets (see Build &amp; Release Strategy). The Docker image is only built and pushed to Docker Hub if a tag is pushed and the corresponding authentication information is configured. The only secret that should be set in each fork is GO_VERSION, specified in Build &amp; Release Strategy, otherwise, the corresponding action’s default version is used.\n\nEach commit has to be signed off, see Contributing Overview.\n\nRunning an adapter as a container\n\nTesting your local changes running as a container can be accomplished in two ways:\n\n\n  Define the adapter’s address in the UI: Unless the running container is named as specified in the docker-run target in the Makefile, the container has to be removed manually first. Then, run make docker followed by make docker-run. Then, connect to the adapter in the UI in “Settings &gt; Adapters” using localhost:&lt;port&gt; if the meshery server is running as a binary, or : if it is running as a docker container.\n  Using mesheryctl: In ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml, change the tag specifying the image of the adapter to “latest”. Run make docker, followed by mesheryctl system start --skip-update. This assumes mesheryctl system start has been executed at least once before.\n\n\nRunning an adapter as a process\n\nAnother way to test your local changes is to run the adapter as a process. To do this, clone the meshery/meshery repository, and start Meshery Server using make server. Start the adapter from your IDE, or by executing make run. Then, in Meshery UI, add the adapter using “localhost:”.\n\nCreating a new Meshery Adapter\n\nMeshery uses adapters to manage and interact with different cloud native infrastructure. Meshery adapters are written in Go. Whether you are creating a new adapter or modifying an existing adapter, be sure to read the Meshery Adapters design specification. For new adapters, start with the Repository Template(https://github.com/layer5io/layer5-repo-template).\n\n\n  Get the proto buf spec file from Meshery repo:\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layer5io/meshery/master/meshes/meshops.proto\n  Generate code\n    \n      Using Go as an example, do the following:\n        \n          adding GOPATH to PATH: export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin\n          install grpc: go get -u google.golang.org/grpc\n          install protoc plugin for go: go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go\n          Generate Go code: protoc -I meshes/ meshes/meshops.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:./meshes/\n        \n      \n      For other languages, please refer to gRPC.io for language-specific guides.\n    \n  \n  Implement the service methods and expose the gRPC server on a port of your choice (e.g. 10000).\n\n\nTip: The Meshery Adapter for Istio is a good reference adapter to use as an example of a Meshery Adapter."

For development use Go version 1.19+.\n\n\nMeshery CLI Reference Documents\nMeshery Command Tracker: Status of mesheryctl command implementation and platform compatibility.\n    Meshery CLI Commands and Documentation: Detailed documentation of the `mesheryctl` commands.\n\tmesheryctl open issues and pull requests: Matching the \"component/mesheryctl\" label.\n\n\n\n    Resource Access\n    Fill-in a community member form to gain access to community resources.\n\n\nMechanics of Contributing\n\nBuilding mesheryctl\n\nThe /mesheryctl folder contains the complete code for mesheryctl. Fork and clone the Meshery repo. cd mesheryctl to change directory mesheryctl’s source.\n\nAfter making changes, run make in the mesheryctl folder to build the binary. You can then use the binary by, say, ./mesheryctl system start.\n\nFramework\n\nmesheryctl uses the Cobra framework. A good first-step towards contributing to mesheryctl would be to familiarise yourself with the Cobra concepts. For manipulating config files, mesheryctl uses Viper.\n\nModel and Configuration Data\n\nA central struct is maintained in the mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/config/config.go file. These are updated and should be used for getting the Meshery configuration.\n\nUpdates to this central struct is made through updates in Context with setter functions. The changes made in this central struct are reflected back in the Meshery configuration file (.meshery/config.yaml).\n\nLogging\n\nFor logs, mesheryctl uses Logrus. Going through the docs and understanding the different log-levels will help a lot.\n\nLinting\n\nmesheryctl uses golangci-lint. See the .github/workflow/ci.yaml for syntax used during Meshery’s build process.\n\nUnit Tests\n\nUnit test code coverage reports can be found in the CodeCov logs. Note: GitHub login may be required for access.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe documentation pages for mesheryctl reference are made with the help of the Cobra Golang framework and use of GitHub Actions. Refer to Contributing to mesheryctl documentation for details.\n\nMeshery CLI Style Guide\n\nThese guidelines are a collection of principles and conventions that need to be followed while designing mesheryctl commands. mesheryctl might be the interface that the users first have with Meshery. As such, mesheryctl needs to provide a great UX.\n\nThe following principles should be taken in mind while designing mesheryctl commands-\n\nDesign Principles\n\n1. Consistency is quality.\n\n\n  Consistency of interaction drives a quality user experience. Whether that experience is delightful or painful is a related, but separate consideration. Meshery’s behavior of user interactions should be consistent even when their user experience is poor.\n\n\n2. Intuitive user experiences feel natural to users.\n\n\n  When being designed, each of Meshery’s user experiences should be examined first from the user’s perspective. Design user experiences that are familiar.\n\n\n3. Design for brevity.\n\n\n  Avoid long commands with chained series of flags.\n\n\n4. Design with automated testing in mind.\n\n\n  Provide possibility to specify output format as json (-o json) for easy inspection of command response.\n\n\nPart of delivering a great user experience is providing intuitive interfaces. In the case of mesheryctl takes inspiration from and delivers similar user experiences as popular CLIs do in this ecosystem, like kubectl and docker. Here is relevant kubectl information to reference - Kubectl SIG CLI Community Meeting Minutes, contributing to kubectl, code.\n\nCommand structure and command behavior should be designed in such a way that they are intuitive. Users should ideally be able to understand what a command is used for without having to extensively go through the documentation. For example, mesheryctl pattern apply -f &lt;pattern name&gt; requires no further clarification as it is evident that the command will apply the pattern specified.\n\nConsistency is key when designing intuitive interfaces. Although mesheryctl perf run -f &lt;performance profile name&gt; may sound more intuitive, users who are experienced in using the CLI will prefer the consistant verb apply over run. This will also ensure a consistent command language making memorizing easier.\n\nFlags\n\nConsistency should also be enforced when chaining commands and using flags. For example, if mesheryctl pattern has a list and view command and has an -all and --output flag, then, similar commands like mesheryctl perf should also support the same commands and flags and provide a consistent user experience.\n\nRational defaults overriden with flags\n\nDefault behaviour should be optimised for what users will need to do most of the time.\n\nThese assumed defaults should be easily overriden by the user with flags.\n\nFor example, mesheryctl system context create &lt;context name&gt; assumes a default platform for the created context. But this can be easily overriden with the --platform flag.\n\nUser Experience: GUI vs CLI\n\nIdeally, all functionaly provided in Meshery UI should be available to users via CLI (in mesheryctl). Meshery strives for parity of functionality between it’s two clients. For example, viewing a performance profile in the GUI and with mesheryctl system perf view &lt;profile name&gt; in the CLI should show the same data.\n\nCommand line interfaces offer less context to the user, which makes them inherently less intuitive compared to graphical user interfaces. Both of these user interfaces, however, are the same in that they are both clients of Meshery Server. Both clients are a user experience and as such, to be attended to in this way. The following considerations should be accounted for when designing mesheryctl experiences:\n\n\n  Provide only relevant output. Use “debug” logs that can be accessed with --verbose flag wherever needed.\n  Add headers to output to give context to the user.\n  As mentioned above, similar commands should behave similarly.\n  Confirm steps for risky commands. For example, use the AskForConfirmation function which will prompt the user to type in “yes” or “no” to continue.\n  Anticipate user actions. If the user creates a new context with mesheryctl system context create then the next action might be mesheryctl system start to start Meshery ot mesheryctl system context switch to switch context names.\n  Anticipate user errors. For example, if the user types in mesheryctl system satrt, using the inbuilt features with the cobra library, we can correct it to start and alert the user.\n\n\nDesigning Commands\n\nIf you are working on a new command or adding a new feature on an existing command, it is recommended to setup a design spec so that other contributors can weigh in on the design before you start to code.Broader features should have a design spec made in Google Doc. Check this Google Doc out, which has detailed information on creating a Design Specification.\nFor small changes, communicating over the issue tracker or the discussions will be helpful.\n\nWhen designing for the command line interface, ask and consider the following questions.\n\nWhat the command does\n\n\n  What makes sense to do from a terminal? What doesn’t?\n  What might people want to automate?\n  What is the default behavior? What flags might you need to change that behavior?\n  What might people try and fail to do and how can you anticipate that?\n\n\nWhat the command is called\n\n\n  What should be the command language? (mesheryctl &lt;command&gt; &lt;subcommand&gt; [args] [flags] [value])\n  What should be a command vs a flag?\n  How can you align the language of the new command with the existing commands?\n\n\nWhat are the command outputs\n\n\n  How can you make the GUI and the CLI outputs similar?\n  What should be outputted normally and what falls into debug logs?\n\n\nHow you would explain your command\n\nYou will need to provide a short and long description of the command for the help pages and also for the Meshery Documentation.\n\nWriting unit tests and integration tests for mesheryctl\n\nUnit tests and integration tests are essential to make each mesheryctl release robust and fault tolerant.\n\nBelow you will find guidelines to write unit tests and integration tests and examples of how they are implemented in mesheryctl.\n\nUnit tests: Individual components are tested.\n\nIntegration tests: Individual components are combined and tested as a group.\n\nContributing to mesheryctl documentation\n\nThe Meshery CLI Reference is autogenerated based on docs sections in each of mesheryctl’s Golang files. Meshery CLI Reference pages are updated each time a change to its respective mesheryctl Golang file is merged into the project’s master branch. This approach to documentation facilitates a single source of truth for CLI syntax and command behavior, which results in higher quality reference and a reduction in the toil involved in keeping documentation up-to-date. To contribute to the Meshery CLI Reference, follow these steps:\n\n\n  Go to the required command file in which the documentation has to be created/updated (mainly under /mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/…)\n  Then, edit the Cobra macro variables present in the each file. An example is given below for reference.\n\n\n\n\nvar startCmd = &amp;cobra.Command{\nUse:   &quot;start&quot;,\nShort: &quot;Start Meshery&quot;,\nLong:  &#39;Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.&#39;,\nArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\nExample:```\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n```,\nAnnotations: linkScreenshot,\n...\n\n\n\nThe variables present in above sample will be used in creating the doc pages for the specific command\n\nAlso, if the screenshot is present in the command, an Annotation macro variable (of map[string]string type) containing the link and the caption has to be added at the bottom of the Examples field in the command file. The image file has to be included in the docs/assets folder in PNG format. The screenshot field is given for reference below\n\n\n\nvar linkDocPatternApply = map[string]string{\n\t&quot;link&quot;:    &quot;![pattern-apply-usage](/assets/img/mesheryctl/patternApply.png)&quot;,\n\t&quot;caption&quot;: &quot;Usage of mesheryctl pattern apply&quot;,\n}\n...\nExample:```\n// apply a pattern file\nmesheryctl pattern apply -f [file | URL]\n\n// deploy a saved pattern\nmesheryctl pattern apply [pattern-name]\n```,\nAnnotations: linkDocPatternApply,\n...\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is advised not to modify the changes in docs folder, rather should be done in mesheryctl folder as the changes will get overwritten by the script.\n\nAdding New/Removing Existing commands in the reference index\n\nThough the command page is generated automatically by the Cobra CLI library, there are chances where the command does not appear in the reference index page. In such cases, the command details must be manually added to the reference index YAML file. This is generally done by editing the below two files:\n\n\n  cmds.yml - The YAML file containing the data about the commands\n  mesheryctl-commands.md - The markdown page of the command reference documentation\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n  jarcoal/httpmock\n  Unit testing CLIs in Go\n  How to test CLI commands with Go and Cobra\n  Contributing to Meshery API Swagger Documentation\n\n\nKey principles\n\nThe following key principles should be taken to mind when writing tests:\n\n\n  Golang’s standard library will be used to write tests.\n  The tests should cover all possible use cases and not just the happy paths.\n  Integration tests should contain the keyword “Integration” in the title and should be marked to be skipped under unit testing. (See below)\n  Fixtures are mock/raw data to use(for e.g. API response to mock an HTTP call).\n  Testdata is the expected response of mesheryctl commands or functions.\n  The mock data and the expected responses are stored in the golden files.\n  Table formatted tests are performed on functions and commands.\n  mesheryctl/pkg/utils/fixtures/validate.version.github.golden file needs to be updated regularly.\n  The version in utils.NewTestHelper() should be updated regularly.\n  Golden files should be updated synchronously as API responses, mesheryctl outputs are updated.\n\n\nMarking integration tests under unit tests\n\nSince there is no straightforward way to mark unit tests and integration tests differently. Here we use the --short flag while running tests to differentiate between unit tests and integration tests.\n\n\n\nfunc TestPreflightCmdIntegration(t *testing.T) {\n   // skipping this integration test with --short flag\n   if testing.Short() {\n       t.Skip(&quot;skipping integration test&quot;)\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, the test is marked with “Integration” in the title and if a --short flag is passed with the command, this test is skipped.\n\nRunning tests in GitHub workflows\n\nUnit tests:\n\n\n\ngo test --short ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic\n\n\n\nIntegration tests:\n\n\n\ngo test -run Integration ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic\n\n\n\nTo update golden files with the test output use the --update flag:\n\n\n\nvar update = flag.Bool(&quot;update&quot;, false, &quot;update golden files&quot;)\n\n\n\nTo grab console logs - fmt.Println() (check mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/perf/view_test.go )\n\nTo grab Logrus logs - logrus.Info() (check mesheryctl/internal/cli/root/perf/apply_test.go )\n\nSuggested Reading"

Jekyll can be installed on different platforms like Windows, Linux, and MacOS by the following steps \n\n\nFor Windows\n\nNote: Windows users can run Jekyll by following the Windows Installation Guide and also installing Ruby Version Manager RVM. RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to work with multiple Ruby environments on your local machine. Alternatively, if you’re running Windows 10 version 1903 Build 18362 or higher, you can upgrade to Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL and run Jekyll in Linux instead.\n\n\n  Fire up your WSL VM and install the ruby version manager (RVM):\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install curl g++ gnupg gcc autoconf automake bison build-essential libc6-dev \\\n \tlibffi-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libsqlite3-dev libtool \\\n \tlibyaml-dev make pkg-config sqlite3 zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev \\\n \tlibreadline-dev libssl-dev\nsudo gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\ncurl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable\nsudo usermod -a -G rvm `whoami`\n\n\n\nIf gpg --keyserver gives an error, you can use:\n\n\n\nsudo gpg --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nsudo gpg2 --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB\n\n\n\nRestart your WSL VM before moving forward.\n\n\n  \n    For installing Ruby, run:\n\n      rvm install ruby\n  rvm --default use ruby 2.7.5\n  gem update\n  gem install jekyll bundler\n    \n  \n  Update the Gemfile located in meshery/docs directory\n      ruby '3.0.2'\n    \n    Note: In place of 3.0.2 add your installed version\n  \n  Also add this to the next line in the Gemfile\n      gem 'wdm','&gt;=0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?\n    \n    Note: This is just a workaround for your local machine so do not commit or push the modified Gemfile or Gemfile.lock during Pull Requests\n  \n  \n    Next, go to this folder on your device\nC:\\Ruby24-x64\\lib\\ruby\\gems\\2.4.0\\gems\\eventmachine-1.2.5-x64-mingw32\\lib\n  \n  Add require 'em/pure_ruby' in the first line of the eventmachine.rb file\n\n\nFor Linux\n\n\n  Prerequisites\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm3 libgdbm-dev\n\n\nInstalling rbenv\n\n\n  Cloning the rbenv repository\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv\n\n\nNote: Change bashrc with your shell specific rc file, for eg: if you are using zsh then the filename is zshrc.\n\n  Setting the path\n\n\n\n\necho &#39;export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n  rbenv init\n\n\n\n\necho &#39;eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n  Reload your bashrc\n\n\n\n\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n  Check installation\n\n\n\n\ntype rbenv\n\n\n\nInstall Ruby\n\n\n  rbenv install version\n\n\n\n\nrbenv install 2.7.5\n\n\n\n\n  To list all the versions that can be installed\n\n\n\n\nrbenv install --list\n\n\n\n\n  Set which Ruby version you want to use\n\n\n\n\nrbenv global version\n\n\n\n\n  Check Ruby installation\n\n\n\n\nruby -v\n\n\n\nFor MacOS\n\n\n  Use docs here Jekyll installation\n\n\nNote: In case of any installation issues, use the discussion forum.\n\nGet the code\n\n\n  Fork and then clone the Meshery repository\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/meshery\n\n\n\n  Change to the docs directory\n\n\n\n\ncd docs\n\n\n\n  Install any Ruby dependencies\n\n\n\n\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\n\n\n\nNote: If you are a Mac user you do not need to install the Ruby dependencies, after moving on to the docs directory, you can serve the site.\n\nServe the site\n\n\n  Serve the code locally\n\n\n\n\nmake docs\n\n\n\n  If that gives an error run:\n\n\n\n\nbundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --config _config_dev.yml\n\n\n\nFrom the Makefile, this command is actually running $ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload --config _config_dev.yml.

Just keep in mind you will have to manually restart the server to reflect any changes made without Livereload. There are two Jekyll configuration, jekyll serve for developing locally and jekyll build when you need to generate the site artefacts for production.\n\nUsing Docker\n\nIf you’ve Docker and make installed in your system, then you can serve the site locally\n\n\n\nmake docker\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t require the need for installing Jekyll and Ruby in your system\n\nBut, you need to make sure that GNU make is working in your system (might not work in Windows)\n\nNote\n\nWhile performing the above step, if you’re facing errors with a message like below…\n\nYour ruby version is x.x.x but your Gemfile specified 2.7.x\n\nThis is because Jekyll always considers the exact version of Ruby unlike JavaScript.\n\nSo, you need to follow either of the three steps to resolve this problem;\n\n\n  Install the required Ruby version by using rvm or by any means given above\n  Alternatively, if you have Docker installed, then type make docker-docs to view the changes\n  If you’re unable to install the required Ruby version, then manually configure the Gemfile as below (not recommended! Do only if above two steps fail):\n\n\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\nruby '2.7.5' //to any version you have installed\n\n\nAutomatically the Gemfile.lock will update once the make docs is given (for Windows, run bundle exec jekyll serve if WSL2 isn’t present)\n\nWARNING: If you have followed the third step then please don’t commit the changes made on Gemfile and Gemfile.lock in your branch to preserve integrity, else the CI action will fail to generate the site preview during PR.\n\nMake Necessary Changes\n\n  Make changes as required by the issue you are solving\n  Be sure check that your changes appear correctly locally by serving the site using make docs\n\n\nNote\n\n  If the issue requires making new doc page that replaces the old page, please don’t forget to add a redirect link on the old page. This redirect link field should have the link of the new page created.\n\n\nCreate a Pull Request\n\n\n  After making changes, don’t forget to commit with the sign-off flag (-s)!\n\n\n\n\ngit commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”\n\n\n\n  Once all changes have been committed, push the changes.\n\n\n\n\ngit push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;\n\n\n\n  Then on Github, navigate to the Meshery repository and create a pull request from your recently pushed changes!\n\n\n\n\n\n  See the Meshery Documentation Google Doc for additional reference.\n\n\nUsing the features of Meshery Docs\n\nClipboard Feature\n\nMost popular clipboard plugins like Clipboard JS require the manual creation of a new ID for each code snippet. A different approach is used here. For code snippets, we either use html tags or markdown in the following manner:\n\n\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;codeblock-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot;&gt;\n&lt;code class=&quot;clipboardjs&quot;&gt;code_snippet_here&lt;/code&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n\n\nYou can also use the code component created for this feature to make it easy to use. It can be used by including code.html and then passing the code snippet to it.\n\nIf the code snippet does not cotain any special characters then, it can be used directly like,\n{% include code.html code=\"code_snippet_here\" %}.\n\nIf the code snippet has special characters then we need to capture it first in variable code_content like this, {% capture code_content%}code_snippet_here{% endcapture %} and then pass it to the component like this, {% include code.html code=code_content %}. That’s it.\n\nNOTE: Don’t use code component when the snippet is in between an ordered list, it breaks the order and next item in the list will have numbering from 1. So better use &lt;pre class=\"codeblock_pre\"&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; method above instead when the snippet is in between an ordered list.\n\nA full block:\n\n\n\n```code snippet```\n\n\n\nInline formatting:\n\n\n\n\\`code snippet\\`: `code snippet`\n\n\n\nLanguage specific:\n\n\n\n```(language name)\ncode snippet\n```\n\n\n\nWhenever the code tags are detected, the clipboard javascript file is automatically loaded. Each code element is given a custom id and a clipboard-copy icon to copy the content.\n\nDocumentation Contribution Flow Summary\n\nNOTE: For contributing mesheryctl reference section, refer Contributing CLI\n\nThe following is a concise summary of the steps to contribute to Meshery documentation.\n\n\n  Create a fork, if you have not already, by following the steps described here\n  In the local copy of your fork, navigate to the docs folder.\ncd docs\n  Create and checkout a new branch to make changes within\ngit checkout -b &lt;my-changes&gt;\n  Edit/add documentation.\nvi &lt;specific page&gt;.md\n  Add redirect link on the old page (only when a new page is created that replaces the old page)\n  Run site locally to preview changes.\nmake docs\n  Commit, sign-off, and push changes to your remote branch.\ngit push origin &lt;my-changes&gt;\n  Open a pull request (in your web browser) against the repo: https://github.com/layer5io/meshery.\n\n\nNavigation Table of Contents in Sidebar (toc)\n\nSidebars use toc to create a table of contents. It is written in the following manner:\n\n    toc:\n  - title: Group 1\n    subfolderitems:\n      - page: Thing 1\n        url: v0.6/thing1.html\n      - page: Thing 2\n        url: v0.6/thing2.html\n      - page: Thing 3\n        url: v0.6/thing3.html\n\n\nThe output of the code snippet would be:\n\n    Group 1\n      Thing 1\n      Thing 2\n      Thing 3\n\n\nAlerts\n\n\nWhat is an alert?\nAn alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary. This example is an info box, and the code for another might look like this:\n\n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Here is another!\" %}\n\n\nJust for fun, here are all the types:\n\n\nwarning\nThis is a warning\n\n\n\ndanger\nThis alerts danger!\n\n\n\nsuccess\nThis alerts success\n\n\n\ninfo\nThis is useful information.\n\n\n\nprimary\nThis is a primary alert\n\n\n\nsecondary\nThis is a secondary alert\n\n\nAlerts\n\n\nWhat is an alert?\nAn alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary.

Isn’t this much more prominent to the user?\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nEditable Intra-page Table of Contents Toolbar\n\nControl the display of this intra-page navigator with either page level or layout level frontmatter variables:\n\ndisplay-toolbar\n\nSet to true (make “editable” toolbar visible) or false (hide “editable” toolbar)\n\nif conditional\n\nThis executes the block of code only if the given condition is true. It is executed in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% if product.title == &#39;Awesome Shoes&#39; %}\n  These shoes are awesome!\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\n\nIf the condition is true, the output would be:\n\n    These shoes are awesome!\n\n\nfor loop\n\nThe for statement executes a block of code repeatedly. It is wriiten in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% for names in collection.names %}\n  {{ name.title }}\n{% endfor %}\n\n\n\nThe output produced by the above code snippet:\n\n    Sam Ham Ethan\n\n\nComment\n\nComments allow to leave a block of code unattended, any statements between opening and closing comment would not be executed.\n\nInclude\n\nThe above tag is used to insert a already rendered file within the current template. It is written in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% include file.html %}\n\n\n\nAssign\n\nThe assign tag is used to create a new variable. It is written in the following manner:\n\n\n\n{% assign variable1 = true %}\n\n\n\nSuggested Reading"

						"categories": "",
						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-error",
						"content": "Meshery pervasively uses MeshKit as a golang and service mesh management-specific library in all of its components. MeshKit helps populate error messages with a uniform and useful set of informative attributes.\n\nTo help with creating error codes, MeshKit contains a tool that analyzes, verifies and updates error codes in Meshery source code trees. It extracts error details into a file that can be used for publishing all error code references on the Meshery error codes reference page. The objective to create this was to avoid centralized handling of error codes and automating everything\n\nIn order to create a Meshery error object, you will need to create a custom wrapper object for the native golang error. This can be done from the MeshKit Error package.\n\nThis tool will create a couple of files, one of them is designed to be used to generate the error reference on the Meshery Documentation website. The file errorutil_analyze_summary.json contains a summary of the analysis, notably lists of duplicates etc.\n\nConventions to follow while creating errors\n\n\n  Errors names and codes are namespaced to components, i.e. they need to be unique within a component, which is verified by this tool.\n  Errors are not to be reused across components and modules.\n  Error codes are not to be set as integer. CI will take care of updating Error codes from a string to an integer.\n  Running make error analyzes your code and returns any warnings to be aware of.\n  Capitalize the first letter of the every error description.\n  Using errors.NewDefault(…) is deprecated. This tool emits a warning if its use is detected.\n  Use errors.New(…) from MeshKit to create actual errors with all the details.\n  This is often done in a factory function. It is important that the error code variable is used here, not a literal.\n  Specify detailed descriptions, probable causes, and remedies. They need to be string literals, call expressions are ignored.\n  This tool extracts this information from the code and exports it.\n  For the Code argument in the errors.New use the same Error name and append a “Code” after it. e.g error name : ErrApplyManifest then the error code is ErrApplyManifestCode\n  Set the value to any string, like “replace_me” (no convention here), e.g. ErrApplyManifestCode = “replace_me”.\n  By convention, error codes and the factory functions live in files called error.go. The tool checks all files, but updates only error.go files.\n\n\nUse the errors.New() function to create a new instance of the error object and pass situation-specific attributes as function arguments. These attributes are:\n\n\n  Code\n  Short Description\n  Long Description\n  Probable Cause\n  Suggested Remediation\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\nerrors.New(ErrExampleCode, errors.Alert, []string{&quot;&lt;short-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;long-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;probable-cause&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;suggested remediation&gt;&quot;})\n\n\nExample\n\nIn this example we are creating an Error for being unable to marshal JSON\n\n\n\nvar (\n\t// Error code\n    ErrMarshalCode= &quot;replace_me&quot;\n\n    //Static errors (for example)\n    ErrExample = errors.New(ErrExampleCode, errors.Alert, []string{&quot;&lt;short-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;long-description&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;probable-cause&gt;&quot;}, []string{&quot;&lt;suggested remediation&gt;&quot;})\n)\n\n// Dynamic errors\n//Error Name\nfunc ErrMarshal(err error, obj string) error {\n\treturn errors.New(ErrMarshalCode, errors.Alert, []string{&quot;Unable to marshal the : &quot;, obj}, []string{err.Error()}, []string{}, []string{})\n}\n\n\n\nReplacing old Error Codes\n\nOld\n\n\n\nbd, err := json.Marshal(providers)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, &quot;unable to marshal the providers&quot;, http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\nNew\n\n\n\nbd, err := json.Marshal(providers)\n  if err != nil {\n          obj := &quot;provider&quot;\n          http.Error(w, ErrMarshal(err, obj).Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n          return\n      }\n\n\n\nReplacing logrus\n\nThere already exists an interface for logger in MeshKit.\n\n\nWARNING\nTo enforce the use of meshkit errors, meshkit logger was designed such that it only works with meshkit errors. If a non-meshkit error is logged through the logger, it would panic and kill the process.

						"title": "Contributing to Meshery using git",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-gitflow",
						"content": "Working by Forking\n\nJust head over to the GitHub page and click the “Fork” button. It’s just that simple. Once you’ve done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or just head straight to the command line:\n\nClone your fork to your local machine\n\ngit clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git\n\n\nKeeping Your Fork Up to Date\nWhile this isn’t a necessary step, if you plan on doing anything more than just a tiny quick fix, you’ll want to make sure you keep your fork up to date by tracking the original “upstream” repo that you forked. To do this, you’ll need to add a remote:\n\nAdd ‘upstream’ repo to list of remotes\n\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/meshery/meshery.git\n\n\n(“meshery” is used as the example repo. Be sure to reference the actual repo you’re contributing to e.g. “meshery-linkerd”).\n\nVerify the new remote named ‘upstream’\n\ngit remote -v\n\n\nWhenever you want to update your fork with the latest upstream changes, you’ll need to first fetch the upstream repo’s branches and latest commits to bring them into your repository:\n\nFetch from upstream remote\n\ngit fetch upstream\n\n\nView all branches, including those from upstream\n\ngit branch -va\n\n\nNow, check out your master branch and merge the upstream repo’s master branch:\n\nCheckout your master branch and merge upstream\n\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\n\n\nIf there are no unique commits on the local master branch, git will simply perform a fast-forward. However, if you have been making changes on master (in the vast majority of cases you probably shouldn’t be - see the next section, you may have to deal with conflicts. When doing so, be careful to respect the changes made upstream.\n\nNow, your local master branch is up-to-date with everything modified upstream.\n\nCreate a Branch (doing your work)\nWhenever you begin work on a new feature or bugfix, it’s important that you create a new branch. Not only is it proper git workflow, but it also keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch so that you can easily submit and manage multiple pull requests for every task you complete.\n\nTo create a new branch and start working on it, perform the following flow.\n\nCheck out the master branch - you want your new branch to come from the master\n\ngit checkout master\n\n\nCreate a new branch (give your branch its own simple informative name)\n\nFor enhancements use feature/your_username/issue# or feature/your_username/name_of_feature\n\nFor bugs use bug/your_username/issue# or bug/your_username/name_of_bug\n\ngit branch feature/jdoe/567\n\n\nSwitch to your new branch\n\ngit checkout feature/jdoe/567\n\n\nNow, go to town hacking away and making whatever changes you want to.\n\nSubmitting your changes (a Pull Request)\n\nBefore submitting your pull request, you might want to do a few things to clean up your branch and make it as simple as possible for the original repo’s maintainer to test, accept, and merge your work.\n\nIn the time that you’ve been working on your changes, if any commits have been made to the upstream master branch, you will need to rebase your development branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward that won’t require any conflict resolution work.\n\nFetch upstream master and merge with your repo’s master branch\n\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\n\n\nIf there were any new commits, rebase your development branch\n\ngit checkout feature/jdoe/567\ngit rebase master\n\n\nNow, it may be desirable to squash some of your smaller commits down into a small number of larger more cohesive commits. You can do this with an interactive rebase:\n\nRebase all commits on your development branch\n\ngit checkout\ngit rebase -i master\n\n\nThis will open up a text editor where you can specify which commits to squash.\n\nSubmitting\n\nOnce you’ve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it.\n\nSuggested Reading"

						"categories": "",
						"url": " /project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide",
						"content": "These guidelines are a collection of principles and conventions that need to be followed while designing mesheryctl commands.\n\nDesign Principles\n\n1. Consistency is quality.\n\n\n  Consistency of interaction drives a *quality* user experience. Whether that experience is delightful or painful is a related, but separate consideration. Meshery’s behavior of user interactions should be consistent even when their user experience is poor.\n\n\n2. Intuitive user experiences feel natural to users.\n\n\n  When being designed, each of Meshery’s user experiences should be examined first from the user’s perspective.\n\n\nCommands should be designed in such a way that they are intuitive. Users should ideally be able to understand what a command is used for without having to extensively go through the documentation.\n\nFor example, mesheryctl pattern apply -f &lt;pattern name&gt; requires no further clarification as it is evident that the command will apply the pattern specified.\n\nConsistency is key when designing intuitive interfaces. Although mesheryctl perf run -f &lt;performance profile name&gt; may sound more intuitive, users who are experienced in using the CLI will prefer the consistant verb apply over run. This will also ensure a consistent command language making memorizing easier. Consistency should also be enforced when chaining commands and using flags.\n\nFor example, if mesheryctl pattern has a list and view command and has an -all and --output flag, then, similar commands like mesheryctl perf should also support the same commands and flags and provide a consistent user experience.\n\nRational defaults overriden with flags\n\nDefault behaviour should be optimised for what users will need to do most of the time.\n\nThese assumed defaults should be easily overriden by the user with flags.\n\nFor example, mesheryctl system context create &lt;context name&gt; assumes a default platform for the created context. But this can be easily overriden with the --platform flag.\n\nUser Experience: GUI vs CLI\n\nIdeally, all functionality provided in Meshery UI should be available to users via CLI (in mesherctl). Meshery strives for parity of functionality between it’s two clients. For example, viewing a performance profile in the GUI and with mesheryctl system perf view &lt;profile name&gt; in the CLI should show the same data.\n\nCommand line interfaces offer less context to the user, which makes them inherently less intuitive compared to graphical user interfaces. Both of these user interfaces, however, are the same in that they are both clients of Meshery Server. Both clients are a user experience and as such, to be attended to in this way. The following considerations should be accounted for when designing mesheryctl experiences:\n\n\n  Provide only relevant output. Use “debug” logs that can be accessed with --verbose flag wherever needed.\n  Add headers to output to give context to the user.\n  As mentioned above, similar commands should behave similarly.\n  Confirm steps for risky commands. For example, use the AskForConfirmation function which will prompt the user to type in “yes” or “no” to continue.\n  Anticipate user actions. If the user creates a new context with mesheryctl system context create then the next action might be mesheryctl system start to start Meshery ot mesheryctl system context switch to switch context names.\n  Anticipate user errors. For example, if the user types in mesheryctl system satrt, using the inbuilt features with the cobra library, we can correct it to start and alert the user.\n\n\nProcess\n\nContributor-facing Design Artifacts\n\nThe following table outlines a set of design artifacts produced in the process of creating and implementing functional specifications.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Document\n      Purpose\n    \n    \n      Meshery CLI Commands &amp; Documentation\n      Overarching index of all mesheryctl commands\n    \n    \n      Meshery CLI Design Specification - See Creating a Functional Specification\n      Breakout of individual command purpose, syntax, flags, and behavior. Links to these separate, breakout documents should be pasted into the Meshery CLI Commands &amp; Documentation doc.\n    \n    \n      Mesheryctl Command Matrix\n      A spreadsheet of all commands, subcommands and flags with an indication of their implementation status would be most helpful for both documentation and planning purposes.\n    \n  \n\n\nUser-facing Documentation Artifacts\n\nThe following table outlines a set of design artifacts produced in the process of creating and implementing functional specifications.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Document\n      Purpose\n    \n    \n      mesheryctl Command Reference\n      Overarching index in the form of succinct, categorized, and tabularly displayed reference of all commands and their syntax with simple example usage.\n    \n    \n      mesheryctl &lt;name of command&gt;\n      Breakout of individual command purpose, syntax, flags, and behavior. Links to these separate, breakout documents should be available from the mesheryctl Command Reference.\n    \n  \n\n\nWhen designing for the CLI, consider…\n\nWhat the command does\n\nWhat makes sense to do from a terminal? What doesn’t?\nWhat might people want to automate?\nWhat is the default behavior? What flags might you need to change that behavior?\nWhat might people try and fail to do and how can you anticipate that?\n\nWhat the command is called\n\nWhat should be the command language? (mesheryctl &lt;command&gt; &lt;subcommand&gt; [args] [flags] [value])\nWhat should be a command vs a flag?\nHow can you align the language of the new command with the existing commands?\n\nWhat the command outputs\n\nHow can you make the GUI and the CLI outputs similar?\nWhat should be outputted normally and what falls into debug logs?\n\nHow you explain your command\n\nYou will need to provide a short and long description of the command for the help pages and also for the Meshery Documentation.\n\nProposing new features / creating a design specification\n\nIf you are working on a new command or adding a new feature on an existing command, it is recommended to setup a design spec so that other contributors can weigh in on the design before you start to code.\n\nBroader features should have a design specification created in the form of a Google Doc. Refer to “Process: Creating a Functional Specification or other Document”, which has detailed information on creating a design specification.\n\nFor small changes, communicating over the issue tracker or the discussions will be helpful.\n\nSuggested Reading"

It is a static representation that defines the structure and properties but does not contain specific configuration values.\n  \n  \n    Definition (static): The definition is an implementation of the schema. It contains specific configurations and values for the construct at hand. The definition provides the actual configuration details for a specific instance of the construct. It is static because it is created based on the schema but does not change once created. The definition is used to instantiate instances of the construct.\n\n     Things to Keep in Mind while creating RelationshipDefinitions:\n\n a. Relationships are defined only between Components.\n b. The values for Kind, Version  and Model are case-sensitive\n c. The convention is to use camel-casing for Kind and SubType values.\n d. Absence of a field means in the selector means “*” (or wildcard).\n     - If we have a selector with {Kind: Pod, Model: Kubernetes}, the absence of the Version field here\n       means that all the versions of the Kubernetes Pod resource (e.g. k8s.io/v1/betav2) will match.\n e. In the event of conflicting Relationship Definitions, union between them is taken.\n     - If we have two Relationships, one from (Component A) to (Component B and Component F), and another\n       from (Component A) to (Component B and Component C), then it is similar to having a Relationship\n       from Component A to Component B, C and F\n f. In the event of an overlapping set of complementary Relationship Definitions, Union.\n g. In the event of an overlapping set of conflicting  Relationship Definitions:\n     - No relationship type (Kind) is inherently more important than the next one, so will not be any case\n       of conflict\n    \n  \n  \n    Instance (dynamic): The instance represents a realized construct. It is a dynamic representation that corresponds to a deployed or discovered instance of the construct. The instance is created based on the definition and represents an actual running or deployed version of the construct within the service mesh environment.\n  \n\n\nIf a specific attribute is not provided with a value in the definition, it means that the value for that attribute has to be written or configured per construct. In other words, the absence of a value indicates that the configuration for that attribute is required and specific to each individual construct instance.\n\n\n\nFigure: MeshModel Contruct Classification\n\nContribute to MeshModel Relationships\n\nRelationships within MeshModel play a crucial role in establishing concrete visualisations of efficient data flow between different components of Meshery. These are used to classify the nature of interaction between one or more interconnected Components.\n\n\n  Identify the relationship and any specific constraints to be enforced between the two specific components, their models or potentially other components, models, or environmental considerations.\n  Propose a specific visual representation for the relationship.\n  Visual representation examples:\n    \n      Hierarchical\n      Sibling\n      Binding\n      Edge\n    \n  \n  Prospose the appropriate relationship type, using one of the predefined set of relationship types or suggest a new relationship where an existing type does not fit.\n  Create a Relationship Definition (yaml).\n  Create a policy for evaluation of the relationship (rego). See examples.\n  Add in Documentation.\n\n\nExisting Relationships, their Definitions and their Subtypes\n\n\n  Hierarchical relationships involve either an ancestral connection of the components i.e. the creation/ deletion of a Component higher up affects the existence of the Components below in the lineage or a connection which involves the inheritence of features from one Component to the other.\n    \n      Parent - A parent-child relationship implies the requirement of the parent component before the child component can be created. For example, a “Namespace” can be a parent of “Pods” within that namespace. The namespace must exist before creating pods within it.\n      Inventory - Wasm filters can inherit features and functionalities from Envoy filters. This can be used to build on existing functionalities provided by Envoy filters and further extend them using Wasm filters. It enables a modular and scalable approach to customize the behavior of the proxy while maintaining a clear hierarchy of features.\n    \n  \n  Edge relationships indicate the possibility of traffic flow between two components. They enable communication and interaction between different Components within the system.\n    \n      Mount - This subtype addresses the storage and access possibility between involved components. For example, a “PersistentVolume” can be mounted to a “Pod” to provide persistent storage for the pod’s data.\n      Network - This deals with IP addresses and DNS names and provides stable endpoints for communication. For example, a “Service” provides a stable endpoint for accessing multiple replicas of a “Deployment.”\n      Firewall - This acts as intermediary for communications which include standard networking protocols like TCP and UDP. It can enforce network policies to control traffic between components. For example, a “NetworkPolicy” can be used to manage the traffic flow between different “Pods” in the cluster.\n      Permission - This defines the permissions for components if they can have a possible relationship with other Components. It ensures that only authorized Components can interact with each other. For example, a “Role” can define permissions for Components to access specific resources.\n    \n  \n  Sibling relationships represent connections between components that are at the same hierarchical level or share a common parent. Siblings can have the same or similar functionalities or may interact with each other in specific ways. These relationships facilitate communication and cooperation between components that are in the same group or category.\n    \n      Sibling\n    \n  \n\n\n\nSee all Visual Representations\n    Hierarchical\n    Hierarchical Parent\n    \n    \n    \n\n    Sibling\n    Sibling\n    \n    \n    \n\n    Binding\n    Binding\n    \n    \n    \n\n    Edge\n    Mount Edge\n    \n    \n\n    \n    Network Edge\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Permission Edge\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Network Policy Edge\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFor more information refer - MeshModel - Construct Models in Meshery"

						"content": "Meshery incorporates an internal events publication mechanism that provides users with real-time updates on the processes occurring within the Meshery server when interacting with its endpoints. It ensures that users are kept in the loop regarding the ongoing activities within the API, and guides users towards future steps to resolve issues. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on sending events from the server, including when to trigger events and what information to include.\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at how the event object is constructed,\n\n\n \n eventBuilder := events.NewEvent()\n                  .ActedUpon(UUID)\n                  .FromUser(UUID)\n                  .FromSystem(UUID)\n                  .WithCategory(string)\n                  .WithAction(string)\n                  .WithSeverity(EventSeverity)\n                  .WithDescription(string)\n                  .WithMetadata(map[string]interface{})\n                  .Build()\n  \n \n  \n\nNote: events is a package github.com/meshery/meshkit/models/events from MeshKit containing source code of event related functionality\n\nThe event mechanism utilizes builder pattern to construct event objects, events.NewEvent() creates an instance of EventBuilder type, which functions as a builder class for constructing Event objects.\n\n\n  ActedUpon(UUID) : it takes UUID of the resource being provisioned on the server, and the events are associated with that resource.\n  FromUser() : it takes UUID of the user initiating the HTTP request to the server. This enables the server to publish events intended for that specific user in response.\n  FromSystem(UUID) : it takes UUID of the running meshery instance (Handler instance contains it h.SystemID).\n  WithCategory : The string argument to specify under which category this event falls, For example, when a user is provisioning a Kubernetes connection, the specified category for the event is “connection.\n  WithAction : The string argument to specify the type of action the server is performing, for instance, when registering a Kubernetes connection, the action would be “register”.\n\n\nNote: categories and actions must be in snake case,\n      example categories: “signup_request”, “github_artifacts”.\n      example actions: “remove_from_organization”, “add_to_organization”.\n\n\n  WithSeverity: it takes EventSeverity (underlying type is string), to specify severity of the event to bring user’s attention to the event accordingly.\n\n\nNote: In certain conditions you must add some fields with specific  keys:\n\n  If the severity is “Error”, include a field in Metadata using the key err with the corresponding error value.\n  \n    When you want to add a link to meshery docs, include a field in Metadata using the key doc with the corresponding link value.\n  \n  WithDescription : The string argument provides a detailed, descriptive message that depicts the specific operation or action being executed on the server.\n  WithMetadata: it takes a Map map[string]interface{} data structure containing any supplementary information that the developer/contributor deems essential for the user to be informed about.\n  Build : returns the Event instance constructed upon the previously described functions and prepares it for publication through the Broadcast, which is responsible for disseminating events.\n\n\nAn Example in Code\n\n\n \nfunc (h *Handler) KubernetesPingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, _ *models.Preference, user *models.User, provider models.Provider) {\n\tuserID := uuid.FromStringOrNil(user.ID)\n\ttoken, ok := req.Context().Value(models.TokenCtxKey).(string)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"failed to get the token for the user\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tconnectionID := req.URL.Query().Get(\"connection_id\")\n\teventBuilder := events.NewEvent().FromUser(userID).FromSystem(*h.SystemID).WithCategory(\"connection\").WithAction(\"ping\")\n\tif connectionID != \"\" {\n\t\t// Get the context associated with this ID\n\t\tk8sContext, err := provider.GetK8sContext(token, connectionID)\n\t\teventBuilder.ActedUpon(uuid.FromStringOrNil(connectionID))\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\teventBuilder.WithSeverity(events.Error).WithDescription(fmt.Sprintf(\"Encountered an issue while retrieving kubernetes context for connection ID `%s`\", connectionID)).\n\t\t\tWithMetadata(map[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\t\t\"error\": err,\n\t\t\t})\n\t\t\tevent := eventBuilder.Build()\n\t\t    _ = provider.PersistEvent(event)\n\t\t    go h.config.EventBroadcaster.Publish(userID, event)\n\t\t\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\t\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"failed to get kubernetes context for the given ID\")\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t\teventBuilder.WithSeverity(events.Success).WithDescription(\"Retrieved kubernetes context successfully\").\n\t\tWithMetadata(map[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\t\"Context Name\":   k8sContext.Name,\n\t\t\t\"Server Address\": k8sContext.Server,\n\t\t})\n\t\tevent := eventBuilder.Build()\n\t\t_ = provider.PersistEvent(event)\n\t\tgo h.config.EventBroadcaster.Publish(userID, event)\n\n\t\t// Remaining code ...\n    }\n}\n \n\n  \n\nIn the given code block, the “resource” refers to the connection on which the server is performing the “ping” action. The “ActedUpon” field is supplied with the “connectionID” value obtained from the query parameter. provider.GetK8sContext returns the K8sContext object which serves as a representation of a Kubernetes context within the Meshery. if provider.GetK8sContext returns an error, the event is constructed with severity Error, description and enriched with metadata fields to provide the user with a complete context about the event.\n\nIf provider.GetK8sContext succeeds, an event with a Success severity level is constructed. The event includes a success message and metadata containing the context name and the address of the Kubernetes API server, obtained from the operation. This information aims to provide users with relevant details about the successful operation.\n\nafter constructing the Event object using the Build function, event is stored into database for records and subsequently published in a new goroutine through EventBroadcaster member variable of HandlerConfig, which is part of Handler instance.\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding and examine events more closely, you can explore the source code files k8config_handler.go and design_engine_handler.go within the Meshery project’s codebase."

						"content": "Prerequisite Reading\n  Contributing to Meshery UI\n\n\nContributing to Meshery UI - Notification Center\n\n\n  \n Your browser does not support the video tag\n\n\nThe NotificationCenter component of Meshery UI Switching to Graphql subscriptions and implementing robust filtering. Events are persisted in Meshery Server and state management on client is done using Redux Toolkit and RTK.\n\nUser-facing Features\n\n\n  Robust filtering support inspired by GitHub’s notification filtering style.\n    \n      Search is also included.\n    \n  \n  Proper hierarchial presentation of error details, including probable cause and suggested remeditation.\n  Suport for notification status (notifications can be marked as read and unread)\n    \n      Future: Notifications can be acknowledged or resolved.\n    \n  \n  Event-based notification via Graphql subscription (provided by Meshery Server and any upstream components or externally managed systems, like Kubernetes)\n  Infinite scroll for pagination.\n\n\nState Management and Internal Details\n\n\n  The State on client is managed using Redux Tooltik and Rtk-query\n  Update and Delete operations are optimistically handled.\n  Network Request are cached and are invalidated when new events come or events are deleted/updated.\n  Due to need for infinite scroll and optimistic update the events are stored globally in Redux.\n\n\nNotification Severities and Colors\n\nNotification severities and colors are defined in the constants file, ui/components/NotificationCenter/constants.js.\n\nNotification Filtering and Searching\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n  Usage\n  Props\n  Examples\n\n\nThe Notfication Center includes a resusable component, TypingFilter, for sophisticated filtering and searching of notifications based on their attributes. It adheres to the GitHub-style syntax for filtering, offering a straight-forward and adaptable way to filter and search notification details. The TypingFilter component is a customizable React component that enables real-time filtering and selection based on user input.\n\nThe state for filtering is managed by a state machine created using a reducer. TypingFilter supports multiple filters, suggestions and completions.\n\nUsage\n\nThe TypingFilter component is designed to provide an interactive filtering experience in your application. Here’s how you can use it:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TypingFilter from './path-to-TypingFilter';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  // Define a filter schema that describes the available filter options.\n  const filterSchema = {\n    // Define your filter categories here\n    // Example:\n    SEVERITY: {\n      value: \"severity\",\n      description: \"Filter by severity\",\n      values: [\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"],\n      multiple : true // default\n    },\n    // Add more filter categories as needed\n  };\n\n  // Define a callback function to handle filter changes.\n  const handleFilterChange = (filteredData) =&gt; {\n    // Implement your logic to react to the filtered data.\n    // This function will be called when the user applies a filter. ( on presing enter in input)\n    console.log(\"Filtered data:\", filteredData);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;TypingFilter\n        filterSchema={filterSchema}\n        handleFilter={handleFilterChange}\n      /&gt;\n      {/* Your other components */}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n\n\nProps\n\nThe TypingFilter component accepts the following props:\n\n\n  filterSchema (object, required): An object that defines available filter options. Each property of this object represents a filter category with the following properties:\n    \n      value (string, required): The filter name used for filtering within the category.\n      description (string, required): Description of the filter category.\n      type (string, optional): The data type of the filter (e.g., “string”, “number”).\n      values (array, optional): Possible values for the filter.\n    \n  \n  handleFilter (function, required): A callback function that is called when the user applies a filter. This function receives the filtered data as an argument.\n\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) for TypingFilter Component\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation used to manage the state of the TypingFilter component. The FSM is responsible for handling user interactions, such as selecting filters, entering values, and clearing the filter, within the component. The FSM implementation within the TypingFilter component ensures that user interactions are correctly processed and managed, resulting in a smooth and intuitive filtering experience.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n  Overview\n  State Definitions\n  Reducers\n  State Transitions\n  Initial State Handling\n\n\nState Definitions\n\nThe FSM code defines three sets of constants to represent important elements within the state management:\n\n1. FILTERING_STATE\n\nDefines the possible states that the TypingFilter component can be in. These states include:\n\n  IDLE: Represents the initial state when the component is not actively filtering.\n  SELECTING_FILTER: Indicates that the user is selecting a filter.\n  SELECTING_VALUE: Indicates that the user is entering a filter value.\n\n\n2. FILTER_EVENTS\n\nRepresents the events that trigger state transitions within the FSM. Some of the events include:\n\n  START: Initiates the filtering process.\n  SELECT: Indicates the selection of a filter.\n  INPUT_CHANGE: Represents a change in the filter input.\n  CLEAR: Clears the filter.\n  EXIT: Exits the filtering process.\n\n\n3. Delimiter\n\nDefines delimiters used to separate filter and value entries within the component. Delimiters include:\n\n  FILTER: Separates multiple filters.\n  FILTER_VALUE: Separates filters from their corresponding values.\n\n\nReducers\n\nThe FSM implementation includes two key reducer functions:\n\n1. commonReducer\n\nThis common reducer function handles events that are common across all states. It includes logic to handle “CLEAR” and “EXIT” events, which reset the component’s state and clear any entered values.\n\n2. filterSelectionReducer\n\nThe filterSelectionReducer is a specific reducer used to manage transitions between “SELECTING_FILTER” and “SELECTING_VALUE” states. It handles events related to selecting filters and entering values. The logic ensures that delimiters are appropriately added or removed when the user interacts with the filter.\n\nState Transitions\n\nState transitions are managed based on user actions and the current state of the component. For example, when the user selects a filter, the state transitions from “SELECTING_FILTER” to “SELECTING_VALUE.” When the user inputs values or clears the filter, the state transitions are managed accordingly.\n\nInitial State Handling\n\nThe FSM implementation includes handling for the initial state, where it listens for the “START” event to transition from “IDLE” to “SELECTING_FILTER.” This ensures that the filtering process is initiated when the user interacts with the component.\n\nBulk Operations\n\nBulk operations in the Notification Center allow users to perform actions like deleting multiple notifications or changing the status of multiple notifications in a batch. This documentation outlines the key features and functionality of bulk operations, including the restriction of performing only one bulk operation at a time, the disabling of buttons during ongoing operations, and the display of a loading icon to indicate ongoing activity.\n\nHow It Works\n\nInitiating a Bulk Operation\n\n\n  Users select the notifications they want to include in the bulk operation. This is typically done by checking checkboxes next to each notification.\n  After selecting notifications, users trigger the desired bulk operation (e.g., delete or change status) by clicking the corresponding action button.\n  Once initiated, the bulk operation begins processing the selected notifications.\n\n\nFurther Enchacements\n\nTo ensure a seamless user experience with bulk operations in the Notification Center, consider the following best practices:\n\n\n  Provide clear and concise messaging to inform users about the progress and outcome of the bulk operation.\n  Implement error handling to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the operation and communicate errors to the user.\n  Consider offering a confirmation dialog before initiating a bulk operation to prevent accidental actions.\n\n\nMetadata Formatter\n\nWhen an event is received from the server, it adheres to a fixed schema containing information that is valuable for presentation to the user. This information typically includes details such as the description, date, user_id, system_id, action, and acted-upon resources. Additionally, sometimes there may be a detailed traceback, a summary, or a comprehensive error log, all of which are dynamically generated data encapsulated within the metadata of the event. Presenting this structured data in a user-friendly manner is a crucial task because it contains valuable insights into ongoing operations.\n\nTo accomplish this task, we employ metadata formatters that transform structured data into visually appealing formats. There are currently two types of formatters in use:\n\n\n  Metadata Specific Formatters: These formatters are specifically designed for particular types of metadata, such as Error and DryRunResponse. Metadata Specific Formatters are implemented as React components that take the metadata as input and render it within the component.\n  Dynamic Formatter: Since metadata can vary significantly in structure, it is not practical to create a specific formatter for each kind. Dynamic formatters analyze the schema’s structure and apply custom-defined rules for formatting:\n    \n      Text strings are rendered using the BodySectionRenderer (more on this later).\n      Arrays are rendered using the ArrayRenderer.\n      Key-value pairs are rendered using the KeyValueRenderer.\n      Nested objects are recursively rendered.\n    \n  \n\n\nBodySectionRenderer\nThe BodySectionRenderer is responsible for formatting and rendering raw text strings into React components. During this process, it parses the string to replace external links with &lt;Link&gt; components and checks if the link matches predefined sites to render the link accordingly.\n\nArrayRenderer\nThe ArrayRenderer is responsible for rendering an array of items in a recursive manner, presenting them as a bulletized list using the MetdataFormatter.\n\nKeyValueRenderer\nObject properties with string values are considered key-value pairs and are rendered as such.\n\nThe Metadata Specific Formatter\nCertain metadata, such as Kubernetes responses and Errors, hold high importance and have dedicated renderers. These dedicated renderers can still utilize the dynamic formatter to format specific parts of the response, such as DryRunResponse.\n\nReusability\nWhile this system was initially developed for our events and notification center, the components it comprises are highly reusable and can be employed in other contexts where dynamic formatting of structured data is required.\n\nSuggested Reading"

						"content": "UI Contribution Flow\n\nMeshery UI is built on React and Next.js. In nearly all cases, while contributing to Meshery UI, you will need to build and run Meshery Server as well. Meshery Server is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. To make building of each component easier a Makefile is included in the main repository folder. Use make to build any and all components.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe following is a list of top-level frameworks, libraries, design system used in Meshery UI.\n\n\n  NextJS - Server and router\n  ReactJS - User Interface library\n  Material UI - Design System\n  BillboardJS - Charting library, used for exposing Grafana and Prometheus-collected metrics\n  CytoscapeJS - a visualization tool for canvas-based, visual topology (networks)\n\n\nMeshery Server APIs\n\nThe API overview in the Extensibility guide offers high-level insight, while each API reference (below) offers details pertaining to each API endpoints’ behavior and use.\n\nREST API\nMeshery provides a REST API available through the default port of 9081/tcp at &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api/. See the REST API Reference for a complete list of endpoints available with short description of their purpose and example code.\n\nGraphQL API\n\nMeshery provides a GraphQl API available through the default port of 9081/tcp at &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api/graphql/query. See the GraphQL API Reference Relay is the client used.\n\nDesign\n\nMeshery UI is a significant component of the value proposition Meshery offers to individuals and organizations seeking to adopt and operate a service mesh or collection of service meshes.\n\nUser Flows / Wireframing / Mockups\n\nFigma is used as the user flow and UI mockup design tool. The Meshery UI design file can be viewed by using this open invitation for view access. Fill-in a community member form to gain access to additional community resources.\n\nDesign Goals\n\nThe designs in this specification should result in enabling:\n\n\n  \n    User experience should be intuitive - Meshery’s UX, which includes Meshery UI as a component of the overall UX, needs to be simple, but powerful. This is achieved through intuitive layouts and predefined filters that accommodate common tasks. This is achieved through sensible defaults, consistency of user interaction paradigms and features that delight the user.\n  \n  \n    Extensible - Meshery UI should be a first-class component of Meshery, but also facilitate third-party integrations.\n  \n  \n    Real-time - Meshery UI should be event-driven where possible.\n  \n\n\nSetup\n\nNode Version Recommendations\nWe recommend using Node 18 LTS. Meshery UI’s build script supports other Node versions as well, including node16 and node17, but is recommended to use Node 18 LTS.\n\nLinting-UI\n\nWhen contributing to Meshery UI, it is advisable to:\n\n\n  Use prettier and eslint plugin for Visual Studio Code.\n  Disable plugins other than prettier and eslint for formatting and linting, if any.\n\n\nInstall UI dependencies\n\nTo install/update the UI dependencies:\n\n\n\nmake ui-setup\n\n\n\nBuild and export UI\n\nTo build and export the UI code:\n\n\n\nmake ui-build\n\n\n\nUsing this command, changes that you make are not rebuilt automatically. You will have to run this command again to rebuild the UI and see them.\n\nNow that the UI code is built, Meshery UI will be available at http://localhost:9081 when Meshery Server is running (Read below).\n\nTo build and export the UI code and build and run Meshery Server:\n\n\n\nmake ui-server\n\n\n\nRun Meshery Server\n\nTo start running Meshery Server locally:\n\n\n\nmake server\n\n\nNow, Meshery will run on the default port http://localhost:9081.\n\nPlease note: If you see “Meshery Development Incompatible” while trying to sign into Meshery Server, then follow these steps:\n\n\n  \n\n\nPotential Solution:\n\n\n  \n    Go to your meshery folder in your local-system where you’ve cloned it.\nExecute:\n  \n  git remote add upstream https://github.com/meshery/meshery\n  git fetch upstream\n  Restart the meshery server\n  Additionally, before restarting the server, if you like to pull the latest changes, you can do: git pull upstream master\n\n\nUI Development Server\n\nIf you want to work on the UI, it will be a good idea to use the included UI development server. You can run the UI development server by running the following command:\n\n\n\nmake ui\n\n\n\nRefer to Contributing to Meshery Server, if needed.\n\n\n  Make sure to have Meshery Server configured, up and running on the default port http://localhost:9081 and choose a provider to login with (visit http://localhost:9081) before proceeding to access and work on the UI server at http://localhost:3000.\n\n\nAny UI changes made now will automatically be rebuilt and served in your browser.\n\nRunning Cypress integration tests\n\nTo run cypress integration tests, a convenience make target called ui-integration-tests that installs dependencies in /ui and /provider-ui folders as prerequisite and invokes ci-test-integration npm script found in /ui/package.json\n\n\nmake ui-integration-tests\n\n\n\nAbove command must be run from Meshery repository's root folder.\n\n\n\nRefer to Meshery Cypress Testing for details of how to contribute and benefit from Meshery Cypress (integration &amp; end-to-end) testing.\n\nStatic Files, Icons and Images\n\nThe Meshery UI public folder contains static files. Its folder structure looks like this:\nmeshery\n└── ui\n    └── public\n        └── static\n            ├── favicon.png\n            ├── fonts\n            ├── img\n            └── style\n\n\nImages and icons used in Meshery UI need to be sourced from the public directory of images. The files written inside this directory should only end with the extensions like .svg, .png, .jpg or .jpeg. Always use vector-based graphics (.svg), unless your have extenuating circumstances.\n\nConventions for SVG files\n\n  SVGs should be optimized and compressed.\n    \n      Use an online, SVG optimizer, like https://www.svgviewer.dev, to compress the file(s) to smaller size.\n    \n  \n  All SVGs should have height and width properties set to 20px x 20px by default. Ensure that height and width attributes are always set in original SVG.\n  All SVGs should have height and width included as a style prop in their React component.\n  Always include this XML header in each SVG image:\n    \n &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE svg&gt;\n \n  \n  Svg can only fall under two categories, and this categories should be the name of folder \n    \n      white: containing white or mono-colored version of that SVG\n      color: containing colored version of that SVG.\n e.g.: the Meshery logo icon folder structure looks like this:\n         └── img\n └── meshery\n     ├── white\n     |   └── meshery-white.svg\n     └── color\n         └── meshery-color.svg\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Avoid any kind of duplicity in the versions of icons used.\n\n\nFor accessing the svg file as data-url, the utf8 encoding should be used in place of base64.Use encodeURIComponent on SVG data URIs. \\\n\n\n\nlet svg = &#39;data:image/svg+xml;utf8,&#39; + encodeURIComponent(svgFile);\n\n\n\nSuggested Reading"

Inform your MeshMate of your current skills and what skills you aim to develop.\n  Run Meshery: Put on your user hat and walk-through all of Meshery’s features and functions as a user.\n  Build Meshery: Confirm that you have a usable development environment.\n  Discuss with the community by engaging in the discussion forum.\n  Contribute by grabbing any open issue with the help-wanted label and jump in. If needed, create a new issue. All pull requests should reference an open issue. Include keywords in your pull request descriptions, as well as commit messages, to automatically close issues in GitHub.\n  Fill-in a community member form community member form to gain access to community resources.\n\n\nGeneral Contribution Flow\n\nTo contribute to Meshery, from creating a fork to creating pull request, please follow the basic fork-and-pull request workflow described here.\n\n\n\nSigning-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)\n\n\n\nTo contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,\nas a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.\n\n\n\nSee the  DCO  file for the full text of what you must agree to\nand how it works here.\nTo signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your\ngit commit messages:\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Jane Smith &lt;jane.smith@example.com&gt;\n\n\n\nIn most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the\n-s or --signoff flag to git commit. You must use your real name and a reachable email\naddress (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:\n\n$ git commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”\n\n\n\nTo ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global .gitconfig:\n\n~/.gitconfig\n\n\n[alias]\n  amend = commit -s --amend\n  cm = commit -s -m\n  commit = commit -s\n\n\nOr you may configure your IDE, for example, VSCode to automatically sign-off commits for you:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeshery Contribution Flow\n\nMeshery is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. UI is built on React and Next.js. To make building and packaging easier a Makefile is included in the main repository folder.\n\nRelevant coding style guidelines are the Go Code Review Comments and the Formatting and style section of Peter Bourgon’s Go: Best\nPractices for Production Environments.\n\nPlease note: All make commands should be run in a terminal from within the Meshery’s main folder.\n\n\n\nPrequisites for building Meshery in your development environment:\n\n\nGo version 1.19 must be installed if you want to build and/or make changes to the existing code. The binary go1.19 should be available in your path. If you don't want to disturb your existing version of Go, then follow these instructions to keep multiple versions of Go in your system.\n GOPATH environment variable should be configured appropriately\n npm and node should be installed on your machine, `node` version 19 or higher is not supported right now.\n Fork this repository git clone https://github.com/meshery/meshery.git, and clone your forked version of Meshery to your development environment, preferably outside `GOPATH`.\n golangci-lint should be installed if you want to test Go code, for MacOS and linux users."

Both databases are considered ephemeral and should be treated as caches. Data retention is tethered to the lifetime of their Meshery Server instance. Remote Providers may offer long-term data persistence. Meshery’s APIs offer mechanisms for clients, like mesheryctl and Meshery UI to retrieve data.\n\nSee the figure below for additional details of the data formats supported and type of data stored.\n\n\n\nComponents\n\nMeshery Database has several kinds of database implementations to support various usecases.

						"content": "Meshery includes a few sample applications to help you explore cloud native infrastructure. Each is a collection of microservices for experimental purposes of learning about running workloads in Kubernetes clusters both on and off of a service mesh. When deploying a sample app onto your service mesh, your sample application needs will need to be externaally exposed from the cluster, if you would like to access it externally. There are a myriad of ways to do this, specific to the service mesh you are using.\n\nA popular way of exposing your cluster is by using Ingress, an API object that defines rules which allow external access to services in a cluster.\n\n\n  Set up Ingress\n  Set up Ingress on Minikube\n\n\nDeploy a sample app on Meshery\n\n\n  \n    Go to the management page of any service mesh and install any of its stable versions.\n\n  \n  \n    Click (+) on Manage Sample Application Lifecycle. You will now be able to see a dropdown menu with the available sample applications.\n\n  \n  \n    Click on the sample application you want to deploy. This might take up to a minute. You will be notified when the sample application has been deployed.\n\n  \n\n\nBookInfo\n\nOriginally built by Istio, BookInfo is a sample application which on deployment displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews. The application comprises of four microservices:\n\n\n  productpage: The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.\n  details: The details microservice contains book information.\n  reviews: The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.\n  ratings: The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.\n\n\nOnce BookInfo is deployed, you can use Meshery to apply custom configurations to control traffic, inject latency, perform context-based routing, and so on.\n\n\n\nEmojivoto\n\nEmojivoto is a microservice application, originally built by Linkerd that allows users to vote for their favorite emoji, and tracks votes received on a leaderboard. The application is composed of three microservices:\n\n\n  emojivoto-web: Web frontend and REST API\n  emojivoto-emoji-svc: gRPC API for finding and listing emoji\n  emojivoto-voting-svc: gRPC API for voting and leaderboard\n\n\n\n\nImageHub\n\nImage Hub is a sample application for exploring WebAssembly modules used as Envoy filters. The application was originally written to run on Consul. However, it doesn’t have any dependency on Consul and can be deployed on any service mesh. These modules can be used to implement multi-tenancy or to implement per user rate limiting in your application’s endpoints, without messing with your application infrastructure. \nFollow this tutorial to set up ImageHub with Ingress\n\n\n\nHTTPBin\n\nHttpBin is a simple HTTP request and response service that responds to many kinds of http/https requests including the standard http request methods (or verbs) used by REST.\n\n\n\nLinkerd Books\n\nLinkerd Books is a sample Ruby based application. It is designed to demonstrate the various value propositions, including debugging, observability, and monitoring of your service mesh. It can be used to scope out your mesh’s efficiency and for debugging.\n\n\n\nOnline Boutique\n\nOnline Boutique is a sample cloud-native application, originally built by Google. It comprises of 10 microservices and can be used to showcase and work with Kubernetes, Istio, gRPC and OpenCensus. On deployment, it runs a web-based e-commerce demo application, an example of which can be seen below:"

						"content": "Error Codes and Troubleshooting\n\nMeshery and its components use a common framework (defined within MeshKit) to generate and document an error with a unique error code identifier: the combination of Meshery component moniker and numberic code - [component-moniker]-[numeric code]. Each error code identifies the source component for the error and a standard set of information to describe the error and provide helpful details for troubleshooting the situation surrounding the specific error.\n\n\nError codes are combination of component moniker and numberic code\n\nNote: The numeric portion of error codes are component-scoped. The numeric portion of error codes are allowed to overlap between Meshery components. The combination of the `[component-moniker]-[numeric code]` is what makes a given error code globally unique.\n\n\nError Code Categories by Component\n\n\n\n  \n    Component Type\n    Component

						"content": "Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: What is Envoy proxy?\n\nAn Envoy is a high performance, programmable L3/L4 and L7 proxy that a number of service mesh use as their data plane. See the service mesh landscape for a complete list. Connection and request handling are at the core of Envoy’s focus. Envoy’s has a pluggable filter module that allows the incorporation of WebAssembly filters that provide additional traffic filtering intelligence. Often this includes higher order functions such as access control, transformation, data enrichment, auditing and more.\n\nQ: What is WASM ?\nWebAssembly is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run in many different environments, including behind Envoy’s Application Binary Interface to extend Envoy with new capabilities. WASM programs are distributed in an efficient portable binary instruction format and embed into isolated execution environments.\n\n&lt;–\nQ: Why does Meshery provide and manage WASM filters?\n\nMeshery manages WASM filters for data plane proxies for:\n\n\n  Agility: in partnership with service mesh control planes, Meshery can dynamically load, configure, and unload filter(s) in running Envoy proxies.\n  Maintainability: To extend the functionality we don’t have to change the entire codebase.\n  Diversity : WASM filters can be easily compiled with many popular programming languages like C/C++ and Rust.\n  Reliability and isolation : WASM filters are deployed into VM and hence they are isolated from the Envoy process. For instance if the WASM filter crashes it will not impact the envoy process.\n  Security : The WASM filter uses a well defined API to connect with the host i.e envoy proxy which can be modified only a limited number of connections.\n  Speed : It is originally used to speed up large web application\n\n\n–&gt;\n\nQ: What are the disadvantages of WASM filters to be taken into consideration?\n\nExecution of WASM filters requires system resources. Just as executing the same functionality that your filter provides outside of the WASM virtual machine, resources can include overhead of latency, CPU, and memory. See the Service Mesh Performance project for more detail.\n\nQ: What is the Envoy Proxy WASM SDK?\n\nEnvoy proxy runs the WASM filter in a stack-based virtual machine so that the filter memory is isolated from the host environment. The interaction between the embedded host i.e. Envoy proxy and the WASM filter are done via call backs and functions by the Envoy Proxy WASM SDK. The Envoy Proxy WASM SDK is implemented in various programming languages like C++, RUST, AssemblyScript and GO(still experimental)\n\nQ: What is Image Hub ?\n\nImage Hub is a sample application which was first officially demonstrated at DockerCon 2020. This sample application is written to run on consul to explore the  WebAssembly (WASM) modules in the Envoy filter. This application is written in the RUST programming language. These modules are used to implement the multi-tenancy or to implement the per user rate limiting in the applications endpoint."

This schema also\ndefines various custom scalar values, such as types for times and dates.\n\nThis schema includes custom scalar types for identifiers, with a specific type for\neach kind of object.\n\nFor more information, read about Scalar Types on graphql.org.\n\nAny\n\nBoolean\n\nRepresents true or false values.\n\nID\n\nRepresents a unique identifier that is Base64 obfuscated. It is often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as \"VXNlci0xMA==\") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.\n\nInt\n\nRepresents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.\n\nMap\n\nString\n\nRepresents textual data as UTF-8 character sequences. This type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.\n\nTime\n\nInput types\n\nTypes that may be used as arguments (all scalar types may also\nbe used as arguments).\n\nOnly general use input types are listed here. For mutation input types,\nsee the associated mutation type above.\n\nFor more information, read about Scalar Types on graphql.org.\n\nAddonStatusInput\n\nInput for changing Addon Status.\n\nArguments\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      k8scontextID\n      String!\n      kubernetes context ID.\n    \n    \n      selector\n      MeshType\n      Filter by Serice Mesh.\n    \n    \n      targetStatus\n      Status!\n      Desired Status.\n    \n  \n\n\nCatalogSelector\n\nArguments\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      order\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      page\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      page_size\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      search\n      String!\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nMeshModelSummarySelector\n\nArguments\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      type\n      String!\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nPageFilter\n\nArguments\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      from\n      String\n       \n    \n    \n      order\n      String\n       \n    \n    \n      page\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      pageSize\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      search\n      String\n       \n    \n    \n      to\n      String\n       \n    \n    \n      updated_after\n      String\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nReSyncActions\n\nType ReSyncActions define the actions involved during resync.\n\nArguments\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      ReSync\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      clearDB\n      String!\n       \n    \n    \n      hardReset\n      String!\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nServiceMeshFilter\n\nFilter Control Plane Query.\n\nArguments\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      k8sClusterIDs\n      [String!]\n       \n    \n    \n      type\n      MeshType\n      Filter by Service Mesh."

With this feature, users can easily import their app manifest and store it in the database.\n\nStep 1: Access the Extensions UI\n\nNote: You can import three types of application: Docker Compose, Helm Chart, Kubernetes Manifest.\n\nStep 2: Navigate to the Applications Tab and Select your Import\n\nOnce you have accessed the Extension’s UI, navigate to the Applications tab. In this tab you can see all your application with their “Name” and “Date Modified”. From the top right of the table click on import application which opens import modal.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Import the Application\n\nYou can import your application by select File Type from the options and clicking on the “Browse” button and selecting the file from your local machine or import in through URL Once you have selected the file, click on the “Import” button to import app into Meshery Extension. When you import a app into Extensions, it will create a Meshery App based on definition. This Meshery App will include all of the services, ports, and other parameters defined in the File.\n\n\n\nOnce the Meshery Application has been created, you can use Meshery Extension to manage, operate and observe your cloud native infrastructure. You can also use Meshery Extension to deploy your Meshery Application to your infrastructure."

						"content": "MeshMap BETA\n\nMeshMap is a GitOps-infused cloud native visual designer for Kubernetes and cloud native applications. MeshMap works with your Kubernetes clusters so that you design and manage your infrastructure and applications between members of your team. MeshMap has two modes: Designer and Visualizer. Create and share your own Kubernetes deployments and patterns in MeshMap Designer. Deploy your designs and manage your infrastructure using MeshMap Visualizer. It includes multi-user collaboration features that allow teams to work together seamlessly towards achieving their goals in a more timely manner. MeshMap aims at removing all the challenging aspects of collaboration from the equation so that everyone on your team can be on the same page when it comes to managing cloud-native infrastructure projects.\n\nGuide to use MeshMap’s features\n\n\n  Publishing a Design - Publish your first design.\n  Sharing a Design - Share your design with friends.\n  Import a Design - Importing a design from catalog or locally.\n  Merge Designs - Merging designs.\n  Import an application - Importing an application of different types.\n  Component Shapes - Know what each component shape signify.\n\n\nMeshMap For GitOps\n\nMeshMap is a valuable GitOps tool for DevOps teams as it allows them to configure, and manage infrastructure resources. This enables streamlining the process of deploying and undeploying large resources and reduces the time and effort required to set up and maintain environments. Additionally, MeshMap provides features such as visualization, collaboration, and snapshots, which can make cloud native business faster. MeshMap also helps DevOps teams maintain a high level of control, and governance by providing a way to define and manage their infrastructure as code. This reduces human error by overcoming the traditional way of configuring YAMLs and ensures compliance with best practices and industry standards.\n\nMeshMap For Developers\n\nFor developers, MeshMap is valuable as it enables them to manage their infrastructure in an effortless manner. This allows developers to concentrate on coding and delivering features instead of infrastructure management. Furthermore, MeshMap offers efficient management of multiple Kubernetes clusters and manifests, guaranteeing consistency and up-to-dateness across development, staging, and production environments. This minimizes the potential for errors, workloads, and inconsistencies in the configurations, as it detects clusters automatically. This ensures the infrastructure is always available.\n\nMeshMap Designer Walkthrough:\n\n\n\nSee on YouTube: MeshMap Designer Walkthrough\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\nNot finding what you're looking for?

It Enables users to visualize the changes being done in the code-base rapidly over each PR and inform the user about any potential changesin their infrastructure. It doesn’t need any configuration or setup neither any deployment by the client rather a simple one time setup is able to provide a long time value.\n\nGuiding Principles\n\nStep 1: The moving banner board to MeshMap\n\nThe screenshots would be flowing through each PR giving product the eye-balls it needs\n\nStep 2: Understanding the designs and infrastructure via visual design without downloading or setting up the MeshMap explicitly\n\nYou don’t have to explicitly install Meshery or MeshMap on your cluster to see their infrastructure or get benefits of the set of capabilities of MeshMap.\n\nStep 3: Introducing MeshMap along with Meshery in the GitOps field.\n\nThis sets the foundation of MeshMap in the github lifecycle, PRs, comments and all for future.\n\nFunctional Sequence Diagram\nFor Github Workflows:\n\n\nExample Usage:\n\nAdd Meshmap Snapshot: Github Pull Request\nConnect MeshMap to your GitHub repo and see changes pull request-to-pull request. Get snapshots of your infrastructure directly in your PRs.\n\nStep 1: Log in to your Meshery Dashboard.\n\nStep 2: Navigate to Extensions and Enable GitHub Action: MeshMap Snapshot.\n\nStep 3: You will be directed to Meshery Cloud.\n\nStep 4: Click on the “Let’s Go” button in the onboarding modal.\n\nStep 5: Now, select the second option, ‘GitOps your infrastructure with MeshMap Snapshot’.\n\nStep 6: Once that’s complete, follow the guided instructions.\n\nSteps 7: Voila, you’re all set!\n\nWhen Infrastructure is located in the file-system\nname: 'MeshMap Snapshot With File-located in Fs'\non: # rebuild any PRs and main branch changes\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - master\n      - 'releases/*'\n\njobs:\n  test: # make sure the action works on a clean machine without building\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set PR number # To comment the final status on the Pull-request opened in any repository\n        run: |\n          export pull_number=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number \"$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH\")\n          echo \"PULL_NO=$pull_number\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # the repository where your infrastructure is located\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 #this step would go and would be no longer needed to be written\n        with:\n          path: action\n          repository: layer5labs/meshmap-snapshot\n      - id: test_result\n        uses: layer5labs/MeshMap-Snapshot@v0.0.4\n        with:\n          githubToken: $ # github's personal access token example: \"ghp_....\"\n          providerToken: $ # Meshery Cloud Authentication token, signin to meshery-cloud to get one, example: ey.....\n          prNumber: $ # auto-filled from the above step\n          application_type: \"Kubernetes Manifest\" # your application type, could be any of three: \"Kubernetes Manifest\", \"Docker Compose\", \"Helm Chart\"\n          filePath: \"action/__tests__/manifest-test\" # relative file-path from the root directory in the github-runner env, you might require to checkout the repository as described in step 2\n\nWhen Infrastructure is identified via URL\nname: 'MeshMap Snapshot With URL-Upload'\non: # rebuild any PRs and main branch changes\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - master\n      - 'releases/*'\n\njobs:\n  test: # make sure the action works on a clean machine without building\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set PR number # To comment the final status on the Pull-request opened in any repository\n        run: |\n          export pull_number=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number \"$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH\")\n          echo \"PULL_NO=$pull_number\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 #this step would go and would be no longer needed to be written\n        with:\n          path: action\n          repository: layer5labs/meshmap-snapshot\n      - id: test_result\n        uses: layer5labs/MeshMap-Snapshot@v0.0.4\n        with:\n          githubToken: $ # github's personal access token example: \"ghp_....\"\n          providerToken: $ # Meshery Cloud Authentication token, signin to meshery-cloud to get one, example: ey.....\n          prNumber: $ # auto-filled from the above step\n          application_type: \"Helm Chart\" # your application type, could be any of three: \"Kubernetes Manifest\", \"Docker Compose\", \"Helm Chart\"\n          application_url: v0.6\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/raw/master/charts/meshery-v0.6.88.tgz\"\n\n\nFileSystem Approach Notes\nThe filesystem-approach asks for your relative file-path and automatically merges all the yaml files together to bundle up into one. So you might like to give the root directory where all the yamls are located. It doesn’t move recursevely in internal folders, so only the first level yaml files are checked.\n\nList of Input variables supported:\ndesignId:  # id of input  #deprecated\n  description: \"The design uuid, example: 3c116d0a-49ea-4294-addc-d9ab34210662\"\n  required: false\n  default: '{}'\napplicationId:  #deprecated\n  description: \"The application uuid, example: 3c116d0a-49ea-4294-addc-d9ab34210662\"\n  required: false\ngithubToken:\n  description: \"Github PAT token\"\n  required: true\nproviderToken:\n  description: \"Meshery Authentication Provider Token\"\n  required: true\ncypressRecordKey:\n  description: \"cypress record key\"\n  required: false\nprNumber:\n  description: \"The Pull request on which comment has to be made\"\n  required: false\n  default: 0\nfilePath: \n  description: \"The relative filepath of the location where the manifests are stored\"\n  required: false\napplication_type:\n  description: \"Application upload type, any of the three, Kubernetes Manifest, Docker Compose, Helm Chart\"\n  required: true\napplication_url:\n  description: \"Application's source url where the manifests or data is stored\"\n  required: false\n\n\nCustomizing Snapshot Workflow Triggers in MeshMap Snapshot\nYou can configure your workflows to run when specific activity on GitHub happens, at a scheduled time, or when an event outside of GitHub occurs.\n\nAbout events that trigger workflows\nGitHub Actions provides a variety of events that can trigger workflows, allowing you to automate your software development process. Each event corresponds to a specific activity, such as creating a pull request, pushing code to a repository, or releasing a new version.\n\nSupported Events\n\nThe MeshMap Snapshot Action supports all of the events listed in the GitHub documentation: \nFor detailed information about each event, including its properties and payloads, refer to the GitHub Actions documentation.\n\nWorkflow Syntax for Event Filtering\n\nWhen defining workflows, you can use the on keyword to specify which events trigger the workflow. You can further filter the triggering conditions by using the types, branches, tags, and other options. For example:\n\non:\n  push: \n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    types:\n      - opened\n      - synchronize\n\n\nSpecific events that are relevant to the MeshMap Snapshot Action are:\n\n\n  push: This event is triggered when code is pushed to the repository. It is the most common event used to trigger workflows.\n  \n    pull_request: This event is triggered when a pull request is opened or updated. It is often used to trigger workflows that run tests or linters on the pull request’s code.\n  \n  workflow_dispatch: This event is triggered when a workflow is manually triggered. It can be used to trigger workflows on demand, such as for publishing a new release or addressing critical bugs.\n\n\nFor a comprehensive list of events that can be used in GitHub Actions, please refer to the Supported Events section above.\n\nWhat Happens to Workflow Customizations on Upgrade?\n\nCustomizations to the trigger criteria for the MeshMap Snapshot actions are preserved when upgrading to a new version of the action. However, there may be some cases where customizations are lost, such as when the syntax for specifying the trigger criteria changes in a new version of the action.\n\nHere are some examples of cases where customizations may be lost:\n\n\n  \n    You currently have a workflow that is triggered on the push event, and the syntax for specifying the push event changes in a new version of the action.\n  \n  \n    You have a workflow that is triggered on a custom event, and the custom event is no longer supported in a new version of the action.\n  \n\n\nIt is always a good practice to test your workflows after upgrading to a new version of the MeshMap Snapshot Action to make sure that your customizations are still working as expected.\n\nUsage:\n\nAfter testing you can create a v1 tag to reference the stable and latest V1 action\n\nGeneral Upgrade Guide\nMeshMap Snapshot Release Page\n\n - id: test_result\n        uses: layer5labs/MeshMap-Snapshot@v0.0.5 # &lt;-- Update the version to latest from the MeshMap-Snapshot release page\n        with:\n        ...\n\n\nUpgrade/Migrate Guide - For Meshery\n\n  Given changes done in action.yml in MeshMap Snapshot, updating the workflows is required.\n  Given changes done other than in action.yml in MeshMap Snapshot, the update in the .github/worflows is not a hard requirement, but doesnt hurt."

						"content": "Meshery’s Preflight Checks\n\nAnytime a mesheryctl system command is executed, a series of preflight checks are run. An attempt will be made to connect to the Kubernetes cluster configured in the user’s kubeconfig as their current-context .\n\n\n  \n    Check whether mesheryctl can initialize a Kubernetes client.\n\n    Situation: mesheryctl fails to query for pods in the default namespace of the user’s current Kubernetes context.\n  \n  \n    Remove ~/.meshery to reinitialize Meshery\n\n    Situation: Unable to start Meshery Server with make run-local due to error of key/value size is invalid\n  \n\n\nSetting up Meshery using Kind or Minikube\n\nThe difficulty with Minikube and Kind clusters is that they typically don’t support LoadBalancer service networking by default. Meshery UI and Meshery Broker are configured for LoadBalancer service networking by default. There are a number of solutions this overcoming this challenge. Here are a few methods:\n\n\n  \n    Use the MetalLB Minikube add-on that provides load balancing. minikube addons enable metallb\n\n    MetalLB setup: link\n  \n  \n    Use Minikube tunnel to expose services. minikube tunnel.\n\n    Docs: link\n\n    A simpler way to resolve this issue can be port-forwarding. Run the following command in terminal:\n\n    kubectl port-forward service/meshery 9081:9081 -n meshery\n  \n  \n    For kind, you can prefer installing MetalLB with a custom configmap.\n\n    Docs: link\n  \n\n\nMeshery Operator\n\nBy default, Meshery Operator is installed in all the connected clusters automatically once Meshery server detects those clusters. The operator can manually be turned off on particular cluster from the settings page.\n\nDisabling the operator\n\nThe env variable DISABLE_OPERATOR=true can be used to signal Meshery server to not install operator in any of the clusters at any point in time after starting. While using Meshery server locally, the make server-without-operator should be used to start Meshery in disabled operator mode.\n\nMeshery Broker\n\nExample of a healthy Meshery Broker server with an actively connected (subscribed) Meshery Server:\n\n➜  ~ kubectl logs -n meshery meshery-broker-0 nats\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.070952 [INF] Starting nats-server version 2.1.9\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.070982 [INF] Git commit [7c76626]\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071308 [INF] Starting http monitor on 0.0.0.0:8222\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071370 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071512 [INF] Server id is NAAYJNX4LDDNXW5UE7IP7PRQR2W2JP546XSFNUWQQHN7JYY27RG47KSG\n[8] 2021/09/08 21:46:03.071516 [INF] Server is ready\n\n\nFor details about the state of the Meshery Server subscription see the http monitor port on Meshery Broker.\n\nMeshery Unable to Connect to Kubernetes\n\nMeshery is unable to detect the Kubernetes connection running on your local system, even after manually uploading the .kube config file\n\nWhen deploying Meshery out-of-cluster, verify your kubeconfig’s contexts and the ability for Meshery Server to reach Kubernetes cluster API from whatever host and network that Meshery Server is being deployed on.\n\n\nkubectl config get-contexts\n\n\nIf you’re using Docker Destkop, consider whether you need to change your current Kubernetes context to docker-desktop.\n\n\nkubectl config use-context\ndocker-desktop\n\n\nMeshery Remote Providers\n\nOnce Meshery is installed, the remote provider “Meshery” can be chosen from UI or by using the command mesheryctl system login:\n\n\n\n➜  ~ mesheryctl system login\nUse the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←\n? Select a Provider:\n  ▸ Meshery\n    None\n\n\nIf you cannot see “Meshery” Remote Provider and find such error logs in Meshery Server’s logs (mesheryctl system logs), please make sure that Meshery Server is able to reach “https://meshery.layer5.io” in order to initialize the “Meshery” Remote Provider.\n\ntime=\"2021-11-10T11:05:30Z\" level=error msg=\"[Initialize Provider]: Failed to get capabilities Get \\\"https://meshery.layer5.io/v0.5.71/capabilities?os=meshery\\\": dial tcp 3.140.89.205:443: i/o timeout\"\n\n\nFor more details about Meshery Providers:\n\n\n  Extensibility: Providers\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n  Meshery Error Code Reference"

Tests that are configured with a high degree of variance (e.g., one test ran for a duration of 5 minutes, while another test ran for a duration of 1 hour) will produce comparisons that are more difficult to extrapolate insights from.\n\nLatency and throughput are the two most significantly examined signals.\n\nMeshery will use different algorithms to calculate results depending upon which load generator was used to run the test."

Install the Meshery command line client, \n\n    mesheryctl\n.\n\n\nMeshery is the open source, cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of Kubernetes, any service mesh, and their workloads.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through an example of deploying Meshery from the App Store of KubeSphere.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n  Please make sure you enable the OpenPitrix system.\n  You need to create a workspace, a project, and a user account (project-regular) for this tutorial. The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the project operator with the operator role. In this tutorial, you log in as project-regular and work in the project demo-project in the workspace demo-workspace. For more information, see Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles.\n\n\nHands-on Lab\n\nPerform the following steps in order:\n\n1. Deploy Meshery from the App Store\n\n\n  On the Overview page of the project demo-project, click App Store in the upper-left corner.\n  \n    Search for Meshery in the App Store, and click on the search result to enter the app.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    In the App Information page, click Install on the upper right corner.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    In the App Settings page, set the application Name, Location (as your Namespace), and App Version, and then click Next on the upper right corner.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Configure the values.yaml file as needed, or click Install to use the default configuration.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Wait for the deployment to be finished. Upon completion, Meshery will be shown as Running in KubeSphere.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n2.

						"content": "Users may prefer to use one load generator over the next given the difference of capabilities between load generators, so Meshery provides a load generator interface (a gRPC interface) behind which a load generator can be implemented. Meshery provides users with choice of which load generator they prefer to use for a given performance test. Users may configure their own preference for the load generator, different from the default load generator.\n\nWhat function do load generators in Meshery provide?\n\nLoad generators will provide the capability to run load tests from Meshery. As of today the load generators are embedded as libraries in Meshery and Meshery invokes the load generators APIs with the right load test options to run the load test. At the moment, Meshery supports HTTP load generation. Support for gRPC and TCP load generation is on the roadmap. Meshery has functional integration with fortio, wrk2, and nighthawk.\n\nWhy support multiple load generators?\n\nDifferent use cases and different opinions call for different approaches to statistical analysis of the performance results. For example, wrk2 accounts for a concept called Coordinated Omission.\n\nWhich load generators does Meshery support?\n\n\n  fortio - Fortio load testing library, command line tool, advanced echo server and web UI in go (golang). Allows to specify a set query-per-second load and record latency histograms and other useful stats.\n  wrk2 - A constant throughput, correct latency recording variant of wrk.\n  nighthawk - Enables users to run distributed performance tests to better mimic real-world, distributed systems scenarios.\n    \n      See the Nighthawk project."

Once you have selected to operate a given service mesh, Meshery will assist you with ongoing operations.\n\nMeshery automates the provisioning of various service meshes, allowing users to select different configuration profiles in order to support a variety of deployment models.\n\nMeshery adapters will dynamically retrieve the specific service mesh’s release package upon initial deployment of a given service mesh. Meshery adapters cache (in .meshery/bin) the service mesh installation package.\n\nDeprovisioning infrastructure\n\nJust as Meshery automates the provisioning of various cloud native infrastructure, so too does it facilitate the deprovisioning of infrastructure. Find the “Undeploy” button in Meshery UI or the --undeploy flag in Meshery CLI.\n\nWorkload Lifecycle Management\n\nUsers may bring their applications (perform workload onboarding) on the service mesh using the Custom Configuration operation.\n\nCommonly adjoining each service mesh is a sample application that facilitates demonstration of the value of the given service mesh. Meshery allows you to efficiently install sample applications across different service meshes.\n\nConfiguration Management\n\nMeshery provides the ability for you as a service mesh manager to customize your service mesh deployment.\n\nNotifications\n\nMeshery tracks operations that you perform on service meshes and their workloads. Meshery provides notification of environment issues, application conflicts with service mesh configuration.\n\nAcknowledging and dismissing notifications\n\nMany notifications are informational and can readily be dismissed after reading. Some notifications include actionable alerts.\n\nTaking action on alerts\n\nParticular notifications that Meshery presents are immediately actionable. These are denoted by a red colored highlight. Be on the lookout for these alerts and take action promptly to ensure a smooth running service mesh."

Installing and playing around with Meshery will give you context for any issues that you might work on.\n\nOnce an issue has been addressed, you’ll need to test it as well. Ideally, these tests are run from the user’s perspective (someone running Meshery in a container), not from a contributor’s perspective (someone running Meshery as a locally-compiled service).\n\nCompiling and Running Meshery server\n\nTo build and run Meshery server from source:\n\n\n  Build the static assets for the UI by running\n\n\n\n\nmake ui-setup\nmake ui-build\n\n\n\n\n  Build &amp; run the server code by running\n\n\n\n\nmake server\n\n\n\nAny time changes are made to the Go code, you will have to stop the server and run the above command again.\nOnce the Meshery server is up and running, you should be able to access Meshery on your localhost on port 9081 at http://localhost:9081. One thing to note, you might NOT see the Meshery UI until the UI code is built as well.\nAfter running Meshery server, you will need to select your Cloud Provider by navigating to localhost:9081.

						"url": " /project/contributing/meshery-windows",
						"content": "Meshery can be run on the Windows platform in three different modes.\n\n  Windows native mode\n  Under WSL or WSL2\n  Using Hyper-V to install a Linux VM to run Meshery.\n\n\nRunning Meshery on WSL(2) or Hyper-V is not much different from running Meshery on a native Linux platform. The same instructions can be followed as already documented.\n\nEssentially, all three platforms require the same prerequisites but the Linux platforms (as there are more than one of them) come with some of the prerequisites that Windows does not.\n\nIn general, all three require that Docker and Kubernetes are present. If Docker Desktop is installed, then Docker actually uses Hyper-V to install a VM. For the requisite images, both Linux and Windows containers are required depending on what one wants to do but the Linux images are certainly required. This is where the exception that was mentioned earlier comes into play, that is if a Kubernetes elsewhere is used. This installation is specified in the config file in the .kube directory in the home directory.\n\nPrerequisite Dependencies\n\nAll three platforms require the following prerequisites:\n\n\n  make\n  gcc\n  nodejs (for npm)\n  go\n\n\nUsing WSL2\n\nHere is a link to setting up WSL2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\n\nOn Windows Native Mode\n\nInstalling Meshery on native Windows may be a little more involved than installing Meshery on a Linux platform. That is because Linux installations usually come with a lot of the prerequisites preinstalled. Moreover, one is given a hint on the Linux platform on what to do next including the command, especially on Ubuntu.\n\nOn Windows, make, gcc and some of the other prerequisites do not come pre-installed, These will need to be installed manually. Also, after installing any of the items, it may be necessary to set its path. This can be done in the control panel by searching for setting the system environment variables.\n\nPlease research the internet to install these components. However, here are a few suggestions:\n\n\n  make: https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm\n  gcc: https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html\n  nodejs (for npm): https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows\n  go: https://go.dev/doc/install\n\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe following minimum Windows build versions are required:\n\n  \n    Name\n    Version \n  \n  \n    WSL1\n    x64 - Windows 7 \n  \n  \n    WSL2\n    x64 - Version 1903, Build 18362; ARM 64 - Version 2004, Build 19041\n  \n  \n    Custom Kernel\n    Build 18945\n  \n  \n    Kernel with K8s required modules\n    Build 19013\n  \n\n\nNote\nRun the following command on Powershell to check your Windows build and version:\n\n [System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version\n \nSteps\nPerform the following steps in order:\n\n1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\n\nOpen Powershell in administrator mode and run:\n\n\n dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\nRestart-Computer\n \n\nChoosing your WSL version:\n\nWSL2 (Recommended)\nSet the default version to WSL2, which will be inherited by any distro you wish to use.\n\nEnable VM (Virtual Machine) feature:\nOpen PowerShell in administrator mode and run:\n\n\n dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n \n\nSet WSL2 as the default version:\n\n\n wsl --set-default-version 2\n \n\n WSL1 \n\nWarning:\nIt is recommended to update to WSL2 as WSL1 doesn’t support the Docker Desktop application for Windows. Instead, it only supports the deprecated version, Docker Toolbox.\n\nIf you still wish to continue, follow the instructions for WSL1\n\n\n\n1. The default version of WSL is set to WSL1 by default. You can move forward to install the distro of your choice. \n\n2. Docker Toolbox \n\nWarning: Docker Toolbox is a deprecated version. It is recommended to update your system and install the Docker Desktop application with WSL2. \n\nDocker Toolbox uses Linux-specific kernel features, and can’t run natively on Windows. Instead, it creates and uses a small Linux VM on your machine along with docker-machine, and uses VirtualBox to run Docker. \n    \n         Go to Toolbox Releases and download the latest release .exe file \n        Follow these instructions to successfully set up the Docker Toolbox application. \n    \n\n\n\n\n2. Install a new distro\nIn this tutorial, Ubuntu 18.04 will be the distro used. Feel free to use any distro of your choice.\n\nNote: If you choose to run Meshery without installing a distro, skip step 2.\n\n3. Enable Docker\n\nThe Docker Desktop application for Windows includes a comprehensive set of tools, including Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Notary, Kubernetes, and a Credential Helper.\n\n\n  \n    Windows 10 Version\n    Docker Desktop \n  \n  \n    Pro/Education/Enterprise\n    Docker Desktop for Windows Pro\n  \n  \n    Home\n    Docker Desktop for Windows Home\n  \n\n\nUsing Hyper-V to install a linux VM\n\nHere is a link to install linux VM using Hyper-V: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hyper-V\n\nGit Bash\nGit Bash is a terminal emulator which provides git command line experience. This will make working with git easier. You can download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n\nGet the code\n\n\n  Fork and then clone the Meshery repository\n    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/meshery"

						"content": "MeshSync\n        \n        Managed by the Meshery Operator, MeshSync is a custom Kubernetes controller that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes clusters and their workloads.\n        \n    \n\n\nKey Features\n\n\n  Greenfield and Brownfield Support: MeshSync discovers and identifies infrastructure whether you’re starting from scratch (greenfield) with Meshery performing the initial deployment of your infrastructure or bringing in Meshery to manage your existing infrastructure (brownfield).\n  Real-time / Event-driven Status: MeshSync subscribes for updates from your platform and listens for state changes, understanding that changes to managed infrastructure may be done out of band of Meshery.\n  Scalable and Performant: Meshery’s event-driven approach ensures speed and scalability. You have control over the depth of object discovery to manage large clusters efficiently. MeshSync’s working snapshot of the state of each cluster under management is stored in the Server’s local database and continuously refreshed.\n\n\nDiscovery\nMeshSync supports both greenfield and brownfield discovery of infrastructure. Greenfield discovery manages infrastructure created and managed entirely by Meshery, while brownfield discovery identifies separately created infrastructure.\n\nBrownfield: Discovering existing resources\n\nThe resources that are present inside the cluster are discovered efficiently with the help of pipelines. The data is constructed in a particular format specific to Meshery and published across to different parts of the architecture.\n\nGreenfield: Tracking newly created resources\n\nMeshery earmarks infrastucture for which it is the orginal lifecycle manager. In other words, Meshery tags the resources it creates. In Kubernetes deployments, earmarking is performed using annotations, notably the key/value pair:\n\ndesigns.meshery.io: &lt;design-id&gt;\n\nThe propagation of the labels and annotations to the native k8s resources would be the responsibility of the workload/trait implementor.\nThe following annotations are added to resources that are created by Meshery Server.\n\nLabels:\n - resource.pattern.meshery.io/id=&lt;uuid&gt; # unique identifier for the design\n\n\nIdentifying Infrastructure under Management\n\nSupplied by Meshery Server, MeshSync uses composite fingerprints to uniquely and positively identify managed infrastructure, capturing essential characteristics like versions and configurations.\n\nComposite Fingerprints\n\nFingerprinting, the process of positively identifying and classifying resources, is performed using a set of pre-defined attributes that have been designated as unique to that type of resource. For example:\n\n\n  Prometheus typically offers metrics on 9090/tcp, but not always.\n  Prometheus is typically deployed from a prebuilt container offered by the open source project, but not always.\n\n\nSee Connnection State Management for additional information.\n\nFingerprinting a service mesh is the act of uniquely identifying managed infrastructure, their versions and other specific characteristics.\n\nAs a guiding principal, each set of composite fingerprints uses the same identifiers that each element management tool uses to identify itself (e.g., istioctl version).\n\nCreating a composite set of keys involves using the builder pattern. For example:\n\n\n  Images\n  CRDs\n  Deployment\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nSubscribing to events/changes on every component\n\nThe informer in MeshSync actively listens to changes in resources and updates them in real time based on the informer configuration in the CRD.\n\nSubscription Status and Health\n\nFlushing MeshSync\n\nSythentic Test of MeshSync\n\nTODO: Include example of how to invoke this built-in check.\nScalability and Performance\n\nOne Meshery Operator and one MeshSync are deployed to each Kuberentes cluster under management.\n\nTiered Discovery\n\nKubernetes clusters may grow very large with thousands of objects on them. The process of positively identifying and classifying resources by type, aligning them with Meshery’s object model can be intense. Discovery tiers (for speed and scalability of MeshSync) successively refine the process of  infrasturcture identification (see Composite Prints).\n\nFor efficient management of large Kubernetes clusters, MeshSync uses tiered discovery. This approach progressively refines the identification of relevant infrastructure, optimizing the speed and scalability of MeshSync. You have control over the depth of object discovery, enabling you to strike the right balance between granularity and performance for efficient cluster management.\nEvent-Driven Implementation\n\nMeshery’s event-driven approach ensures high-speed operations, making it suitable for managing both small and large clusters. Meshery Broker uses NATS as the messaging bus to ensure continuous communication between MeshSync and Meshery Server. In case of connectivity interruptions, MeshSync data is persisted in NATS topics.\n\nMeshSync FAQs\n\nHow to configure MeshSync’s resource discovery behavior: Can specific, “uninteresting” resources be blacklisted?\n\nMeshSync is managed by Meshery Operator, which watches for changes on the meshsync CRD for changes and updates the deployed MeshSync instance accordingly. You can blacklist specific Kubernetes resources from being discovered and watched by MeshSync. In order to identify the list of one or more resources for MeshSync to ignore, update the meshsync CRD using kubectl:\n\n\n  Download the CRD with kubectl get crd meshsyncs.meshery.layer5.io -o yaml &gt; meshsync.yaml\n  Open the downloaded file and edit the field informer_config to blacklist all the types of resources that you don’t want updates from.\n  Apply the new definition with kubectl apply -f meshsync.yaml\n\n\nRoadmap\n\nNon-Kubernetes Deployments\n\nEven if you’re not using Kubernetes, Meshery empowers you to manage your infrastructure efficiently, providing a unified solution for different deployment environments.\n\nRecap\n\nMeshSync maintains an up-to-date snapshot of your cluster, ensuring you always have an accurate view of your infrastructure. This snapshot is refreshed in real-time through event-based updates. Whether you’re starting fresh or adopting Meshery into existing setups, MeshSync supports both greenfield and brownfield discovery of your environment.\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nSuggested Reading\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nRecent Discussions with \"meshery\" Tag\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 05 | \n     Issue locating Istio from the Lifecycle menu\n    \n          by \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 26 | \n     Contribute to Design and Documentation Projects\"\n    \n              by Hauwa Ismail Ahmad \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     May 16 | \n     Error in setting up the development environment\n    \n                by ujjwal soni\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 25 | \n     [Recap] Meshery Development Meeting 25th Oct, 2023]\n    \n                      by Saurabh Soni\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Jun 09 | \n     Make Server Error\n    \n                        by \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 18 | \n     Error in Visualizer mode - (Uh-oh!😔 Please pardon our mesh.- plugin: not implemented)\n    \n                                by Roshan Goswami\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 18 | \n     I encountered an error on my local machine after running 'make ui'\n    \n                                by Roshan Goswami\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 18 | \n     Web GUI cannot be displayed\n    \n                                      by \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Oct 18 | \n     [Recap] Meshery Development Meeting 18th Oct, 2023\n    \n                      by Saurabh Soni\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Jul 23 | \n     Unable to start meshery after installing it\n    \n                                        by Yana Gupta"

						"content": "Meshery’s internal object model is designed to provide a consistent and extensible way of capturing and characterizing the resources under Meshery’s management. Meshery Models serve as an internal model within Meshery, defining constructs and their relationships, and enabling consistent communication between components.\n\nKey aspects and characteristics of Meshery Models\n\nDesign Principles\nMeshery Models adheres to several design principles, including establishing a set of constructs, clearly defining construct boundaries, allowing construct extension, reusing existing models, being user-centric, and simplifying complex networking and distributed systems.\n\nCore Constructs\n\nModels introduces various core constructs that form the foundation of the model. Some of the core constructs mentioned in the document include Components, Designs, Patterns, Traits, Metrics, Actions, Color, and Relationships. Models having the same name and version attributes are considered duplicates.\n\nComponent\n\nComponents represent entities in the Meshery ecosystem, exposing capabilities of the underlying platform. They can be registered, created, and used by users and operators. Components have definitions, instances, and associated metadata. Components having the same kind, apiVersion and model.name attributes are considered duplicates.\n\nDesign\n\nDesigns are deployable units in Meshery that describe the desired infrastructure. They consist of components and patterns, allowing users to define and configure the behavior of their cloud-native applications.\n\nPattern\n\nPatterns augment the operational behavior of a deployed instance of a design. They define best practices for configuring and operating cloud-native application functionality. Patterns can be applied to components or designs, and they are read-only.\n\nTrait\n\nTraits provide additional details about a component in Meshery. They offer specific functionality or characteristics associated with a component, enhancing its capabilities. Traits can be attached to components to customize their behavior.\n\nMetrics, Actions, Color\n\nMeshModel includes constructs for managing metrics, defining actions, and specifying color properties of components or designs. These constructs help in monitoring, controlling, and visualizing different aspects of the Meshery ecosystem.\n\nRelationships\n\nRelationships define the nature of interaction between interconnected components in MeshModel. They represent various types of connections and dependencies between components, such as hierarchical, network, or default relationships. Relationships have selectors, metadata, and optional parameters.\n\nModel Packaging\n\nMeshModel supports packaging constructs as OCI-compatible images, making them portable and encapsulating intellectual property. Model packages can include multiple MeshModel constructs, facilitating reusability and versioning.\n\nEvaluation and Policies\n\nMeshModel provides a model evaluation algorithm to ensure desired behavior enforcement. Policies can be applied to components and relationships, defining rules and actions based on predefined conditions."

						"content": "Advanced Configuration\n\nMeshery is capable of running zero or more adapters. Meshery offers many features without the need for adapters. Adapters are optional components that enhance and extend Meshery’s core functionality.\n\nModifying the default adapter deployment configuration\n\nThe number of adapters, type of adapters, where they are deployed, how they are named and what port they are exposed on are all configurable deployment options. To modify the default configuration, find ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml on your system. ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml is a Docker Compose file.\n\nConfiguration: Running fewer Meshery adapters\n\nTo customize which Meshery Adapters are used in which deployments, customize your contexts in your meshconfig.\n\nRecommended:\nConfigure your meshconfig, using mesheryctl system context to customize which Meshery Adapters are used in which deployments.\n\nAlternative:\nAlternatively, directly modify the ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml configuration file, remove the entry(ies) of the adapter(s) you are removing from your deployment.\n\nConfiguration: Running more than one instance of the same Meshery adapter\n\nThe default configuration of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the Meshery adapters (that have reached a stable version status). You may choose to run multiple instances of the same type of Meshery adapter; e.g. two instances of the Meshery Adapter for NGINX Service Mesh. To do so, you can use either of Meshery’s clients or to modify your Meshery deployment:\n\n  Using mesheryctl, modify ~/.meshery/meshery.yaml to include multiple copies of the given adapter.\n  Using Meshery UI, navigate to the Settings page and enter the host and port of your additional adapter.\n\n\nConfiguration: Choosing an adapter while installing Mesheryctl\n\nWhile installing mesheryctl using bash installation script, we can choose which adapter to be loaded.\nThis is done by passing ADAPTERS environment variable to meshery bash script.\n\nFor e.g. \ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | ADAPTERS=consul PLATFORM=kubernetes bash - installs mesheryctl and starts Meshery Server in your connected Kubernetes cluster deploying only the Meshery Adapter for Consul and not the rest of Meshery’s adapters.\n\nDemo of Meshery managing deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters:\n\n\n\nSee on YouTube: Cloud Native Austin Virtual Meetup: April 2020"

						"content": "As the cloud native management plane, Meshery enables the adoption, operation, and management of Kubernetes clusters and their lifecycle. Meshery’s powerful performance management functionality is useful whether you are running workloads on Kubernetes or outside of Kubernetes.\n\nMeshery implmenents both Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and Service Mesh Interface (SMI) and Meshery is the conformance tool for SMI. Meshery integrates with Open Application Model (OAM) to enable users to deploy service mesh patterns. Meshery enables operators to deploy WebAssembly filters to Envoy-based data planes. Meshery facilitates learning about functionality and performance of service meshes and incorporates the collection and display of metrics from applications running on or across service meshes.\n\nMeshery’s Functionality\n\nMeshery features can be categorized by:\n\n\n  Cloud Native Performance Management\n    \n      Workload and cloud native performance characterization\n      Prometheus and Grafana integration\n    \n  \n  Cloud Native Configuration Management\n    \n      Configuration best practices\n    \n  \n  Cloud Native Lifecycle Management\n    \n      Cloud native provisioning and workload onboarding\n      Meshery Operator and MeshSync\n      Cloud native patterns and Open Application Model integration\n    \n  \n  Data Plane Intelligence\n    \n      Registry and configuration of WebAssembly filters for Envoy\n    \n  \n  Cloud Native Interoperability and Federation\n    \n      Manage multiple service meshes concurrently\n      Connect to multiple clusters independently\n    \n  \n\n\nMeshery is for Developers, Operators, and Product Owners\n\nWhether making a Day 0 adoption choice or maintaining a Day 2 deployment, Meshery has useful capabilities in either circumstance. Targeted audience for Meshery project would be any technology operators that leverage service mesh in their ecosystem; this includes developers, devops engineers, decision makers, architects, and organizations that rely on microservices platform.\n\nMeshery is for cloud native patterns\n\nThrough Models, Meshery describes infrastructure under management, enabling you to define cloud native designs and patterns and then to export those designs and share within the Meshery Catalog.\n\nMeshery is for performance management\n\nMeshery helps users weigh the value of their cloud native deployments against the overhead incurred in running different deployment scenarios and different configruations. Meshery provides statistical analysis of the request latency and throughput seen across various permutations of your workload, infrastructure and infrastructure configuration. In addition to request latency and throughput, Meshery also tracks memory and CPU overhead in of the nodes in your cluster. Measure your data plane and control plane against different sets of workloads and infrastructures.\n\nAnytime performance questions are to be answered, they are subjective to the specific workload and infrastructure used for measurement. Given this challenge, many projects refuse to publish their own performance data, because such tests can be quite invovled and misinterpreted.\n\nBeyond the need for performance and overhead data under a permutation of different workloads (applications) and types and sizes of infrastructure resources, the need for cross-project, apple-to-apple comparisons are also desired in order to facilitate a comparison of behavioral differences between cloud native and selection of their use. Individual projects shy from publishing test results of other, competing service meshes. An independent, unbiased, credible analysis is needed.\n\nMeshery is intended to be a vendor and project-neutral utility for uniformly benchmarking the performance of cloud native infrastructure. Between service mesh and proxy projects (and surprisingly, within a single project), a number of different tools and results exist. Meshery allows you to pick an efficient set of tools for your ecosystem by providing performance evaluation and metrics.\n\n\n  By leveraging Meshery you can achieve apples-to-apples performance comparison\n  Track your service mesh performance from release to release.\n  Understand behavioral differences between cloud native infrastructure.\n  Track your application performance from version to version.\n\n\n\nEstablish a performance benchmark and track performance against this baseline as your environment changes over time.\n\nMeshery is for all cloud native infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure diversity is a reality for any enterprise. Whether you’re running a single Kubernetes cluster or multiple Kubernetes clusters, you’ll find that Meshery supports your infrastructure diversity (or lack thereof)."

						"content": "What are Cloud Native Patterns?\nThis feature area is under active development. Until additional documentation is published,see the Meshery and cloud native patterns design specification for further details.\n\n\nUse Meshery to Deploy a Cloud Native Pattern\n\nYou can use Meshery to deploy a cloud native pattern. Cloud native patterns are detailed as a YAML file. See the Configuration Management guide.\n\nPattern Repository\n\nSee Meshery Catalog.\n\nYou may bring your own patterns or find them available through your chosen provider. Each cloud native pattern carries a unique identifier for reference. The patterns in this repository serve in an educational capacity, facilitating learning, and also serve in an operational capacity, facilitating implementation and validation of your cloud native deployment’s adherence to a pattern.\n\n\nRepository of Cloud Native Patterns\nA central set of design patterns is available in Meshery Catalog (concept, site).\n\n\nImporting Patterns\n\nYou can import a pattern using mesheryctl or Meshery UI. Patterns can be imported from your local filesystem, an HTTP/S endpoint, or from GitHub. When provided a GitHub location (org/repo), Meshery will recursively search the given directory (or the entire repository) for existing pattern files.\n\nUsing Meshery CLI\n\nTo import a pattern, execute this command:\n\n$ mesheryctl pattern import -f &lt;path to the pattern&gt;\nImporting pattern…\nPattern successfully imported.\n\nUsing Meshery UI:\n\nFrom Meshery UI, patterns can be imported from your local filesystem or imported from a remote URL.\n\n\n    \n\n\nTo upload from url click the link icon\n\n\n    \n\n\nTo deploy a pattern, execute this command:\n\n$ mesheryctl pattern apply -f &lt;path to the pattern&gt;\nDeploying pattern…\nPattern successfully applied.\n\n\nFrom here, output and behavior will vary based upon the specific pattern you’re deploying. Should you find that your pattern is not successfully deployed, refer to the pattern troubleshooting guide in the Meshery documentation.\n\nAs you step through each pattern, you might choose to modify the pattern to suit your specific environment and workload, exploring in-context of your specific situation. Optionally, you may choose to use a plugin like MeshMap, or another visual cloud native topology tool, to facilitate your comprehension of the patterns and to literally see the patterns in-action.\n\nTake time to explore. Try deploying one cloud native’s sample application onto a different cloud native and compare differences in behavior and each cloud native’s ability to manage it. If using Meshery to do so, execute the following commands as an example to deploy the sample application, BookCatalog, onto Open cloud native:\n\n$ mesheryctl pattern apply -f book-catalog\nDeploying application “BookCatalog”...\nDeployed. Endpoint(s) available at: http://localhost:8000/catalog\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n  mesheryctl pattern"

Users can either use the Meshery UI, the CLI, mesheryctl or run performance tests in their CI/CD pipelines using the Meshery GitHub Action.\n\nInstalling Meshery\n\nInstall and login to Meshery to start running performance benchmarks. See Installation documentation for detailed steps on how to install Meshery.\n\nMeshery dashboard\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to run performance benchmarks on a service mesh, you can use Meshery’s service mesh lifecycle management capabilities to deploy a service mesh and deploy your application on the mesh.\n\nWith Meshery’s performance benchmarking feature, you can also deploy you application off the mesh and compare the performance and determine the overhead when the app runs on the mesh.\n\nTo install a service mesh, see this guide.\n\nMeshery also comes with a set of sample applications that you can quickly deploy to test out the capabilities of your service mesh.\n\nNext, we navigate to the main Performance Testing dashboard. See Performance Management to learn more about performance profiles, load generators, Kubernetes cluster, and service mesh metrics.\n\nRunning Performance Benchmarks Through Meshery UI\n\nMeshery UI provides an easy-to-use interface in which users can create performance profiles to run repeated tests with similar configuration and can also even schedule performance tests to be run at particular times through the calendar.\n\nOn the navigation menu, click on performance.\n\nThis will open the performance management dashboard as shown below.\n\n\n\nPerformance Management Dashboard\n\nTo create a performance profile, click on “Manage Profiles” and then select “+ Add Performance Profile”.\n\n\n\nPerformance Profiles\n\nThis will open up a popup window where you can fill out the test configuration for running your benchmarks.\n\n\n\nConfiguring a Performance Test\n\nYou can now save the profile and run the test. The test will continue to run in the background even if you close the popup.\n\n\n\nOnce the test is done, you would be able to see the results of the test below.\n\n\n\nPerformance Test Results\n\nYou can then go back to your performance profile and get these results anytime.\n\nYou can also compare different test results in Meshery and draw insights. For example, you can run this test with your application running on different service meshes and check which performs better.\n\n\n\nSelecting multiple test results\n\n\n\nComparing multiple test results\n\nRunning Performance Benchmarks Through mesheryctl\n\nThe mesheryctl perf subcommand provides the performance management features of Meshery in the CLI.\n\nTo run a performance test based on a performance profile, run:\n\nmesheryctl perf apply Istio Performance Test\n\n\nYou can also use flags to configure your performance test. For example:\n\nmesheryctl perf apply istio-soak-test --concurrent-requests 1 --duration 15s --load-generator nighthawk --mesh istio --url http://localhost:2323\n\n\nmesheryctl also supports test configurations written in SMP compatible format as shown below:\n\ntest:\n  smp_version: v0.0.1\n  name: Istio Performance Test\n  labels: {}\n  clients:\n    - internal: false\n      load_generator: fortio\n      protocol: 1\n      connections: 2\n      rps: 10\n      headers: {}\n      cookies: {}\n      body: ''\n      content_type: ''\n      endpoint_urls:\n        - 'http://localhost:2323/productpage'\n  duration: '30m'\nmesh:\n  type: 3\n\n\nAnd then you can pass this file to mesheryctl as:\n\nmesheryctl perf apply -f perf-config.yaml\n\n\nYou can also override the configuration passed in the file with flags like shown below:\n\nmesheryctl perf apply -f perf-config.yaml --url http://localhost:2323/productpage?u=test --load-generator nighthawk --qps 5\n\n\nRunning Performance Benchmarks in your Pipelines\n\nMeshery also has a meshery-smp-action which is a GitHub action that can be used to run performance tests in your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nDownload the token from the Meshery Dashboard by clicking on the profile icon on the top-right corner.\n\nDownloading the token\n\n\n\nYou can use this token to authenticate the instance of Meshery running in your CI/CD workflow.\n\n\nUsing the token in GitHub workflows\nYou can use the secrets feature in GitHub to store the token.\n\n\nThe action can be used by defining your test configuration in a performance profile in Meshery or by writing your test configuration in SMP compatible format.\n\nThe action can then be configured as shown below:\n\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: $\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n\n\nMore configuration details of the action can be found here.\n\nSee sample configurations for more workflow examples using this action."

Service Mesh Performance  and Service Mesh Interface are two open specifications that address the need for universal interfaces for interacting with and managing any type of service mesh. Let’s examine what each specification provides.\n\n\n\nService Mesh Performance standardizes service mesh value measurement, characterizing any deployment’s performance by capturing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration and workload metadata.\n\n\n\nService Mesh Interface provides a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. These (currently) four specfications offer a common denominator set of interfaces to support most common service mesh use cases and the flexibility to evolve to support new service mesh capabilities over time.\n\nAs a service mesh agnostic tool that provides lifecycle and performance management of a large number of (10+) service meshes, Kubernetes applications, service mesh patterns and WebAssembly filters, Meshery is the ideal tool for the job when it comes to implementing these specifications.\n\nMeshery also comes with two new GitHub Actions that do exactly this. The Meshery SMI Conformance Action which validates SMI conformance in your pipeline and the Meshery SMP Action which runs SMP compatible performance benchmarks.\nBut how do we use these actions? What do they offer? Let’s find out!\nService Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action\n\nConformance of SMI specifications is defined as a series of test assertions. These test assertions are categorised by SMI specification (of which, there are currently four specifications) and comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. Conformance requirements will change appropriately as each new version of the SMI spec is released. Refer to Meshery’s documentation for details of how Meshery performs SMI conformance.\n\nUsing Meshery's SMI Conformance GitHub Action\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action is available in the GitHub Marketplace. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event.\nAn example of the action configuration which runs on every release is shown below.

Meshery is the canonical implementation of the Service Mesh Performance specification. You can choose from multiple load generators and use a highly configurable set of load profiles with variable tunable facets to run a performance test. Meshery packages all these features into an easy-to-use GitHub Action.\n\nUsing Meshery's Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action is available in the GitHub Marketplace.You can create your own performance profiles to run repeatable tests with Meshery. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event. A sample configuration of the action is shown below.\n\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: $\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n\n\nYou can also define your test configuration in an SMP compatible configuration file as shown below.\n\nsmp_version: v0.0.1\nid:\nname: Istio Performance Test\nlabels: {}\nclients:\n- internal: false\n  load_generator: fortio\n  protocol: 1\n  connections: 2\n  rps: 10\n  headers: {}\n  cookies: {}\n  body: \"\"\n  content_type: \"\"\n  endpoint_urls:\n  - http://localhost:2323/productpage\nduration: \"30m\"\n\n\nSee this sample GitHub workflow (action.yml) for more configuration details.\n\n\n\nThe results from the tests are updated on the Performance Management dashboard in Meshery.

						"url": " /playground",
						"content": "Try out Meshery Playground at https://playground.meshery.io/\n\nMeshery Playground is a web-based, collaborative environment that provides you with the ability to explore not only Meshery as a cloud native manager, but also all of the infrastructure that it manages, including multiple Kubernetes clusters, every CNCF project and application, service, or operator that runs on Kubernetes. Meshery Playground provides a sandboxed environment to experiment with different infrastructure configurations and deployment options. Its multi-player plugins allow you to collaborate in real-time with your teammates on infrastructure design and operation.\n\nWith Meshery Playground, you can:\n\n\n  Collaborate with other engineers, share your knowledge, and exchange ideas\n  Explore new cloud native tools without the need for complex setup or configuration. Simply open your browser and go.\n  Design new cloud native scenarios and easily deploy them in the Playground environment. Keep your designs and deploy them in your own environment when you’re ready.\n\n\nYou can interactively explore any service mesh like Istio, Linkerd, Consul, Kuma, and so on without having to install them on your local machine. You can create virtual services and deploy sample applications using these meshes and observe their behavior in real-time.\n\nMeshery Playground also has pre-built scenarios that demonstrate how to implement specific use-cases such as traffic splitting, circuit breaking, and other cloud native patterns.\n\nMeshery Playground FAQ\nQuestion: Why do I need to sign-up/register to use the Cloud Native Playground?\nAnswer: The Playground is connected to live Kubernetes clusters, and while these clusters are refreshed on a daily basis, the clusters do need to be protected from nefarious actors, who might use these clusters for cryptomining, for example.\n\nSign-up to receive a user account, entitled with perpetually free and full access the Playground environment.\n\nThe Meshery Playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full-control over those clusters. Requiring users to register a user account keeps the Playground safe and healthy for all to enjoy. Without requiring users to sign-in, the Meshery Playground would allow anonymous access for anyone and everyone to potentially perform nefarious acts.\n\nQuestion: Will I lose my Meshery designs in the Cloud Native Playground?\nAnswer: No, all of the designs that you have created in the Meshery Playground are saved to your user account and will be available to you each time you sign into your account. Your designs will be available in the Meshery Playground and any your other Meshery deployments, too.\n\nIn other words, all work done in MeshMap Designer is persisted to your user account.\n\nQuestion: Will I lose my Meshery deployments in the Cloud Native Playground?\nAnswer: Yes, the Meshery Playground clusters are reset on a daily basis. However, only deployments (not designs) that you may have created will be lost.\n\nIn other words, only MeshMap Visualizer is reset. All of your work in Meshery UI and MeshMap Designer will remain in your user account.\n\nQuestion: Is there a demo user account that everyone can use?\nAnswer: It is imperative that each user has their own account to ensure seamless real-time collaboration within the Playground. The use of individual accounts is critical to enable multiple people to access and utilize the powerful collaboration features.\n\nCreating your own account ensures that any designs you create or save will be stored and accessible across sessions, preventing any loss of work.\n\nTo ensure accountability in the Playground, it’s crucial to promote the use of individual named accounts. This helps prevent bad actors from hiding behind anonymous general-use accounts and maliciously abusing the Playground. Therefore, the use of named accounts is an essential step towards achieving this goal.\n\nQuestion:Can I deploy the Meshery on-premises?\nAnswer: Yes, Meshery can be deployed on-premises with a single command to download, install, and run your own instance of Meshery in your environment. See all supported platforms to deploy your own Meshery instance at https://meshery.io"

						"content": "Meshery Overview\n\nAs the collaborative cloud native manager plane, Meshery enables the design, operation, and management of Kubernetes clusters and their workloads. Meshery’s powerful performance management functionality is accomplished through implementation of Cloud Native Performance. Meshery Catalog enable users to capture and share cloud native design patterns. Meshery enables operators to deploy WebAssembly filters to Envoy-based data planes. Meshery facilitates learning about functionality and performance of infrastructure and incorporates the collection and display of metrics from applications.\n\nMeshery’s Functionality\n\nMeshery features can be categorized by:\n\n\n  Cloud Native Performance Management\n    \n      Workload and infrastructure performance characterization\n      Prometheus and Grafana integration\n    \n  \n  Cloud Native Configuration Management\n    \n      Configuration best practices\n      Configuration support for hundreds of integrations\n    \n  \n  Cloud Native Lifecycle Management\n    \n      Cloud native provisioning and workload onboarding\n      Cloud native design patterns and sharing via catalog\n    \n  \n  Data Plane Intelligence\n    \n      Registry and configuration of WebAssembly filters for Envoy\n      Filter chaining and publishing to content catalog\n    \n  \n  Cloud Native Interoperability and Federation\n    \n      Manage multiple Kubernetes clusters concurrently\n    \n  \n\n\nMeshery is for Developers, Operators, and Product Owners\n\nWhether making a Day 0 adoption choice or maintaining a Day 2 deployment, Meshery has useful capabilities in either circumstance. Targeted audience for Meshery project would be any technology operators that leverage cloud native infrastructure in their ecosystem; this includes developers, devops engineers, decision makers, architects, and organizations that rely on microservices platform.\n\nMeshery is for cloud native design patterns\n\nMeshery integrates with hundreds of infrastructure and application components to enable users to deploy cloud native design patterns.\n\nMeshery is for performance management\n\nMeshery helps users weigh the value of their workload deployments against the overhead incurred while running cloud native infrastructure. Meshery provides statistical analysis of the request latency and throughput seen across various permutations of your workload, infrastructure and configuration.\nIn addition to request latency and throughput, Meshery also tracks memory and CPU overhead in of the nodes in your cluster. Measure your data plane and control plane against different sets of workloads and infrastructures.\n\nAnytime performance questions are to be answered, they are subjective to the specific workload and infrastructure used for measurement. Given this challenge, the Envoy project, for example, refuses to publish performance data because such tests can be:\n\n\n  Involved\n  Misinterpreted\n\n\nBeyond the need for performance and overhead data under a permutation of different workloads (applications) and types and sizes of infrastructure resources, the need for cross-project, apple-to-apple comparisons are also desired in order to facilitate a comparison of behavioral differences between cloud native infrastructure and selection of their use. Individual projects shy from publishing test results of other, competing projects. An independent, unbiased, credible analysis is needed.\n\nMeshery is vendor and project-neutral. Meshery’s performance management features allow you to uniformly benchmarking the performance of cloud native infrastructure. Meshery allows you to pick an efficient set of tools for your ecosystem by providing performance evaluation and metrics.\n\n\n  By leveraging Meshery you could achieve apples-to-apples performance comparison of cloud native infrastructure\n  Track your instructure and application performance from release to release.\n  Understand behavioral differences between releases of your infrastructure.\n  Track your application performance from version to version.\n\n\n\nEstablish a performance benchmark and track performance against this baseline as your environment changes over time.\n\nMeshery is for all cloud native infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure diversity is a reality for any enterprise. Whether you’re running a single Kubernetes cluster or multiple clusters, you’ll find that Meshery supports your infrastructure diversity (or lack thereof)."

						"content": "Meshery offers Providers as a point of extensibility. With a built-in Local Provider (named “None”), Meshery Remote Providers are designed to be pluggable. Remote Providers offer points of extension to users / integrators to deliver enhanced functionality, using Meshery as a platform. A specific provider can be enforced in a Meshery instance by passing the name of the provider with the env variable PROVIDER.\n\n\n  Extensibility points offer clean separation of Meshery’s core functionality versus plugin functionality.\n    \n      Meshmap is an example of a feature to be delivered via Remote Provider.\n    \n  \n  Remote Providers should be able to offer custom RBAC, custom UI components, and custom backend components\n    \n      Dynamically loadable frameworks need to be identified or created to serve each of these purposes.\n    \n  \n\n\nDesign Principles: Meshery Remote Provider Framework\n\nMeshery’s Remote Provider extensibility framework is designed to enable:\n\n\n  \n    Pluggable UI Functionality:\n\n    \n      Out-of-tree custom UI components with seamless user experience.\n      A system of remote retrieval of extension packages (ReactJS components and Golang binaries).\n    \n  \n  \n    Pluggable Backend Functionality:\n\n    \n      Remote Providers have any number of capabilities unbeknownst to Meshery.\n    \n  \n  \n    Pluggable AuthZ\n    \n      Design an extensible role based access control system such that Remote Providers can determine their own set of controls. Remote Providers to return JWTs with custom roles, permission keys and permission keychains.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWhat functionality do Providers perform?\n\nWhat a given Remote Provider offers might vary broadly between providers. Meshery offers extension points that Remote Providers are able to use to inject different functionality - functionality specific to that provider.\n\n\n  Authentication and Authorization\n    \n      Examples: session management, two factor authentication, LDAP integration.\n    \n  \n  Long-Term Persistence\n    \n      Examples: Storage and retrieval of performance test results.\n      Examples: Storage and retrieval of user preferences.\n    \n  \n  Enhanced Visualization\n    \n      Examples: Creation of a visual service mesh topology.\n      Examples: Different charts (metrics), debug (log viewer), distributed trace explorers.\n    \n  \n  Reporting\n    \n      Examples: Using Meshery’s GraphQL server to compose new dashboards.\n    \n  \n\n\nTypes of providers\n\nTwo types of providers are defined in Meshery: local and remote. The Local provider is built-into Meshery. Remote providers are may be implemented by anyone or organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery. Any number of Remote providers may be available in your Meshery deployment.\n\nRemote Providers\n\nUse of a Remote Provider, puts Meshery into multi-user mode and requires user authentication. Use a Remote provider when your use of Meshery is ongoing or used in a team environment (used by multiple people).\n\nName: “Meshery” (default)\n\n\n  Enforces user authentication.\n  Long-term term persistence of test results.\n  Save environment setup.\n  Retrieve performance test results.\n  Retrieve conformance test results.\n  Free to use.\n\n\nLocal Provider\n\nUse of the Local Provider, “None”, puts Meshery into single-user mode and does not require authentication. Use the Local provider when your use of Meshery is intended to be shortlived.\n\nName: “None”\n\n\n  No user authentication.\n  Container-local storage of test results. Ephemeral.\n  Environment setup not saved.\n  No performance test result history.\n  No conformance test result history.\n  Free to use.\n\n\nBuilding a Provider\n\nMeshery interfaces with Providers through a Go interface. The Provider implementations have to be placed in the code and compiled together today. A Provider instance will have to be injected into Meshery when the program starts.\n\nMeshery keeps the implementation of Remote Providers separate so that they are brought in through a separate process and injected into Meshery at runtime (OR) change the way the code works to make the Providers invoke Meshery.\n\nRemote Provider Extension Points\n\nInterwoven into Meshery’s web-based, user interface are a variety of extension points. Each extension point is carefully carved out to afford a seamless user experience. Each extension point is identified by a name and type. The following Meshery UI extension points are available:\n\n\n  \n    Name: “navigator”\nType: Menu Items\nDescription: This is supposed to be a full page extension which will get a dedicated endpoint in the meshery UI. And will be listed in the meshery UI’s navigator/sidebar. Menu items may refer to full page extensions.\n  \n  \n    Name: “user_prefs”\nType: Single Component\nDescription: This is supposed to be remote react components which will get placed in a pre-existing page and will not have a dedicated endpoint. As of now, the only place where this extension can be loaded is the “User Preference” section under meshery settings.\n  \n  \n    Name: “account”\nType: Full Page\nDescription: Remote Reactjs components (or other) are placed in a pre-existing page and will have dedicated endpoint: /extension/account.\n  \n  \n    Name: “collaborator”\nType: Single Component\nDescription: This is supposed to be remote react components which will get placed in a pre-existing page and will not have a dedicated endpoint. Currently, placed at the Header component of Mehery UI.\nIts work is to show active Meshery users under the same remote provider.\n  \n  \n    Name: /extension/&lt;your name here&gt;\nType: Full Page\nDescription: The Provider package is unzipped into Meshery server filesystem under /app/provider-pkg/&lt;package-name&gt;.\n  \n\n\nRemote Providers must fulfill the following endpoints:\n\n\n  /login - return valid token\n  /logout - invalidating token\n  /capabilities - return capabilities.json\n\n\nUI Extension Points\n\nAll UI extensions will be hosted under the endpoint &lt;mesheryserver:port/provider&gt;\n\nUserPrefs\n\nThe UserPrefs extension point expects and loads a component to be displayed into /userpreferences page.\n\nNavigator\n\nThe Navigator extension point loads a set of menu items to be displayed in the menu bar on the left hand side of the Meshery UI.\n\nCapabilities Endpoint Example\n\nMeshery Server will proxy all requests to remote provider endpoints. Endpoints are dynamically determined and identified in the “capabilities” section of the /capabilities endpoint. Providers as an object have the following attributes (this must be returned as a response to /capabilities endpoint):\n\n\n\n{\n  &quot;provider_type&quot;: &quot;remote&quot;,\n

&quot;endpoint&quot;: &quot;/api/connection&quot;\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nMeshery Server Registration\n\nEvery Meshery server is capable of registering itself with the remote provider, considering that remote provider supports this feature as a capability.\nOn successful authentication with the remote provider, Meshery server registers itself by sending a POST request to the remote provider through the persist-connection capability. The body of the request should include information so as to uniquely indentify Meshery server and its status.\n\nExample of the request body:\n\n\n\n\n  {\n    &quot;server_id&quot;: &quot;xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx&quot;,\n    &quot;server_version&quot;: &quot;vx.x.x&quot;,\n    &quot;server_build-sha&quot;: &quot;xxxx-xxxxx&quot;,\n    &quot;server_location&quot;: &quot;&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;”\n  }\n\n\n\n\nConfigurable OAuth Callback URL\n\nAs of release v0.5.39, Meshery Server has extended its capability to configure the callback URL for connected Remote Providers. Helpful when you are deploying Meshery behind an ingress gateway or reverse proxy. You can specify a custom, redirect endpoints for the connected Remote Provider.\n\nExample Deployment Scenario: Meshery Cloud, Istio, and Azure Kubernetes Service\n\nUser has deployed the Meshery behind a Istio Ingress Gateway and the Istio is also behind an Application Gateway (e.g. AKS Application Gateway). Generally, when you use a GitHub Remote Provider for authentication, it redirect the request to the Istio Ingress Gateway FQDN. In this setup, redirection won’t be successful because the Ingress Gateway is behind an additional Application Gateway. In this case, you have to define where the request should be redirected once it is authenticated from GitHub.\n\nSolution:\n\nYou can define your custom callback URL by setting up MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL env variable while installing meshery in your K8s cluster.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you are deploying Meshery using Helm, you can configure the MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL as shown in the following example.\n\n\n  Custom url: v0.6https://k8s-staging.test.io/\n  Auth Endpoint: api/user/token (append at the end of your custom URL)\n\n\n\n\nhelm install meshery meshery/meshery --namespace meshery --set env.MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL=https://k8s-staging.test.io/api/user/token\n\n\n\nNote\n\nWith a path like, https://k8s-staging.test.io/meshery, your callback URL will be https://k8s-staging.test.io/meshery/api/user/token.\n\nManaging your Remote Provider Extension Code\n\nRemote Provider extensions are kept out-of-tree from Meshery (server and UI). You might need to build your extensions under the same environment and set of dependencies as Meshery. The Meshery framework of extensibility has been designed such that in-tree extensions can be safely avoided while still providing a robust platform from which to extend Meshery’s functionality. Often, herein lies the delineation of open vs. closed functionality within Meshery. Remote Providers can bring (plugin) what functionality that they want behind this extensible interface (more about Meshery extensibility), at least that is up to the point that Meshery has provided a way to plug that feature in.\n\nOffering out-of-tree support for Meshery extensions means that:\n\n\n  source code to your Meshery extensions are not required to be open source,\n  liability to Meshery’s stability is significantly reduced, avoiding potential bugs in extended components.\n\n\nThrough clearly defined extension points, Meshery extensions may be offered as closed source capabilities that plug into open source Meshery code. To facilitate integration of your Meshery extensions, you might automate the building and releasing of your separate, but interdependent code repositories. You will be responsible for sustaining both your ReactJS and Golang-based extensions."

Meshery requires a valid token in order to allow clients to invoke its APIs.\n\n\n  Authentication\n  Requests to any of the API endpoints must be authenticated and include a valid JWT access token in the HTTP headers. Type of authentication is determined by the selected [Provider](#providers). Use of the Local Provider, \"None\", puts Meshery into single-user mode and does not require authentication. \nWhat are authentication tokens?\nMeshery authentication tokens allow users or systems to authenticate with Meshery Server via either its two clients, Meshery CLI and Meshery UI, or its two APIs: REST or GraphQL. Meshery's authentication token system provide secure access to Meshery's powerful management features.\n\n\n\n\nHow to get your token\n\nThere are two ways to get your authentication token:\n\n\n  Meshery UI\n\nUsing Meshery UI, you can get a copy of your authentication token by following these steps:\n\n\n1. Log into Meshery by selecting your identity provider of choice (typically found at http:\\\\{meshery-server}:9081/provider)\n   \n\n2. Navigate to your user's avatar in the upper righthand corner and select \"Get Token\" from the dropdown of profile section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Meshery CLI\n  \nUsing Meshery CLI, you can get a copy of your authentication token by executing this command:\n  \n  \n  \n  mesheryctl system login\n  \n  \n  \n  In order to use this command, you must have a web browser available on your system (this command cannot be executed on a headless system).\n\n\n\nHow to access Meshery’s REST API\n\n\n  Example using curl\n  \nUsing curl, you can access Meshery's REST API by executing this command:\n  \n  \n  \n  curl --location 'localhost:9081/api/&lt;endpoint&gt;' \\\n--header 'meshery-token: &lt;yourToken&gt;\\\n--header 'Cookie: meshery-provider=Meshery; meshery.layer5.io_ref=/;token=&lt;yourToken&gt;\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nSelf-generated documentation based on Meshery’s OpenAPI specification for it’s REST API.\n\nMeshery’s REST API can be explored interactively using the Swagger UI Playground.\n\nEndpoints"

						"content": "Meshery’s CLI, mesheryctl, includes commands for verifying system readiness for a Meshery deployment and health checks to confirm the health of an existing Meshery deployment. Whether you have yet to deploy Meshery or have already deployed Meshery, mesheryctl system check is a useful utility to ensure that your Meshery deployments are healthy.\n\n\nmesheryctl system check\n\n\n\nVerify environment pre/post-deployment of Meshery.\n\nUsage:\nmesheryctl system check [flags]\n\nFlags:\n--adapter Check status of Meshery adapters\n-h, --help help for check\n--operator Check status of Meshery operators\n--pre Verify environment readiness to deploy Meshery\n--preflight Verify environment readiness to deploy Meshery\n\nGlobal Flags:\n--config string path to config file (default \"/Users/navendu/.meshery/config.yaml\")\n-c, --context string (optional) temporarily change the current context.\n-v, --verbose verbose output\n-y, --yes (optional) assume yes for user interactive prompts.\n\n\nDeployment checks\n\nmesheryctl system check command can run two types of system checks. A pre-deployment check which verifies the environment to deploy Meshery and a post-deployment check which runs validation checks on a running Meshery deployment.\n\nPre-deployment checks\n\nPre-deployment checks runs checks on the environment and verifies whether it is ready for deploying Meshery.\n\nThe following checks are done here:\n\n\n  Docker health checks: Checks for the availability of Docker and docker-compose in the user’s machine\n  Kubernetes health checks: Checks for the availability of a Kubernetes cluster and checks if Meshery can initialize a Kubernetes client\n  Kubernetes version checks: Checks if kubectl and the Kubernetes version are higher than the minimum supported versions\n\n\nPre-deployment checks are run with the --preflight flag as shown below:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check --preflight\n\n\nPost-deployment checks\n\nPost-deployment checks are run after deploying Meshery in the user’s environment. These checks ensure that the running deployment of Meshery and Meshery adapters are working as expected.\n\nIn addition to the pre-flight checks, the following checks are also run in this check:\n\n\n  Meshery version checks: Checks the version of Meshery server and CLI and shows if a new version is available\n  Meshery Adapter health checks: Checks if all the specified adapters are deployed and reachable\n\n\nPost-deployment checks are run as shown below:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check\n\n\nAdditional checks\n\nTo check the status of the deployed adapters only, users can leverage the --adapter flag as shown below:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check --adapter\n\n\nUsers can also narrow down the tests to just check the status of the Meshery operator deployed on their Kubernetes cluster:\n\n\nmesheryctl system check --operator\n\n\nFAQ\n\nQuestion: While running mesheryctl system check --preflight it says I didn’t install Kubernetes, but I have Docker installed and the test returned “Meshery prerequisites met”. Is that all good?\n\nAnswer: Yes, as long as you’ve Docker installed, it’s fine to run Meshery. But you will need a Kubernetes cluster to handle tasks such as deploying service mesh and so on, if you want to do them via Meshery.\n\nQuestion: I ran a preflight check to see if I satisfy all requirements for Meshery in my system. It returned postive results but I couldn’t start Meshery. What to do?\n\nAnswer: Make sure if you’ve configured your system to run Meshery in smooth manner. For configuration, do check out the docs site and this page to see instructions related to the platform you use.\n\nQuestion: Do I need a Kubernetes cluster or will a Docker host suffice for Meshery deployments?\n\nAnswer: Meshery’s performance management functionality does not require a Kubernetes cluster. The rest of Meshery’s functionality (e.g. cloud native management) does require a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nQuestion: What are Meshery’s production deployment requirements?\n\nAnswer: One or more Kubernetes clusters. A stateful set for Meshery Server in order to persist performance test results. See #2451.\n\nQuestion: For system checks, do I need any add-ons to pass the check?\n\nAnswer: Not necessary. Basic requirements are enough to pass the check.\n\nQuestion: The Adapter check is failing, it returns “Auth token not found”.\n\nAnswer: You can log in to Meshery using mesheryctl system login which would generate an OAuth token. Once the OAuth token is generated, the check will start to function\n\nQuestion: I have a Kubernetes cluster enabled but Meshery couldn’t reach the cluster and the checks are failing! What to do?\n\nAnswer: To resolve this error, you can upload your kubeconfig file in the Meshery UI under settings and Meshery will reconfigure to use your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nQuestion: Under Meshery Version test, I’m getting an error like “CLI is not up-to-date”. Should I update mesheryctl often?\n\nAnswer: Yes! You should update the mesheryctl often in order to run Meshery smoothly. The reason behind it is because not only the CLI is updated, but also the Meshery app. So it is advisable to update Meshery often.\n\nQuestion: Is it advisable to keep Meshery in sleep mode while running system checks?\n\nAnswer: Not necessary. It is good to keep Meshery up and running, else the system checks will fail to detect the Meshery version.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum version of k8s cluster and kubectl required to run Meshery?\n\nAnswer: For Kubernetes, version &gt;=1.12.0 is recommended. For kubectl version &gt;=1.12 is recommended.\n\nQuestion: In the “Meshery Adapter” section of check, I could see only some service mesh adapters up and running and not all. Is this fine?\n\nAnswer: Not a problem, if you feel you need to have all mesh adapters to be up running, you can do so by creating a new context mesheryctl system context create [context-name] --set (if you voluntarily deleted mesh adapters in your current context)\n\nQuestion: I started Meshery fresh, didn’t change any of the details in the context I have. But I see that all adapter checks are failing. What to do?\n\nAnswer: Configure Meshery to use on your Kubernetes cluster, then upload the kubeconfig file via Meshery UI to notify Meshery to use that cluster. If that didn’t work, feel free to open up an issue in GitHub.\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nFor an exhaustive list of mesheryctl commands and syntax:\n\n\n  See mesheryctl Command Reference.\n\n\nGuides to using Meshery’s various features and components.\n\nSuggested Reading\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nRecent Discussions with \"mesheryctl\" Tag\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n     Sep 05 | \n     While Setting Environment  for Meshery, Facing issue\n    \n          by Shailika Sahu\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Aug 18 | \n     Invalid Component Error while starting meshery system\n    \n                    by Rajdeep Sengupta\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     Aug 17 | \n     Mesheryctl is not updating on the latest macOS Sonoma beta.

We investigate every report thoroughly.\n\nTo make a report, send an email to the private\n[security@meshery.dev](mailto:security@meshery.dev)\nmailing list with the vulnerability details. For normal product bugs\nunrelated to latent security vulnerabilities, please head to\nthe appropriate repository and submit a [new issue](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/new/choose).\n\n### When to report a security vulnerability?\n\nSend us a report whenever you:\n\n- Think Meshery has a potential security vulnerability.\n- Are unsure whether or how a vulnerability affects Meshery.\n- Think a vulnerability is present in another project that Meshery\ndepends on (Docker for example).\n\n### When not to report a security vulnerability?\n\nDon't send a vulnerability report if:\n\n- You need help tuning Meshery components for security.\n- You need help applying security related updates.\n- Your issue is not security related.\n\nInstead, join the community [Slack](https://slack.meshery.io/) and ask questions.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe Meshery team acknowledges and analyzes each vulnerability report within 10 working days.\n\nAny vulnerability information you share with the Meshery team stays\nwithin the Meshery project. We don't disseminate the information to other\nprojects. We only share the information as needed to fix the issue.\n\nWe keep the reporter updated as the status of the security issue is addressed.\n\n### Fixing the issue\n\nOnce a security vulnerability has been fully characterized, a fix is developed by the Meshery team.\nThe development and testing for the fix happens in a private GitHub repository in order to prevent\npremature disclosure of the vulnerability.\n\n### Early disclosures\n\nThe Meshery project maintains a mailing list for private early disclosure of security vulnerabilities. \nThe list is used to provide actionable information to close Meshery partners. The list is not intended \nfor individuals to find out about security issues.\n\n### Public disclosures\n\nOn the day chosen for public disclosure, a sequence of activities takes place as quickly as possible:\n\n- Changes are merged from the private GitHub repository holding the fix into the appropriate set of public\nbranches.\n\n- Meshery team ensures all necessary binaries are promptly built and published.\n\n- Once the binaries are available, an announcement is sent out on the following channels:\n  - The [Meshery blog](https://meshery.io/blog/)\n  - The [Meshery Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/mesheryio)\n  - The [#announcements](https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/CSF3PSZT9) channel on community [Slack](https://slack.meshery.io/)\n\nAs much as possible this announcement will be actionable, and include any mitigating steps customers can take prior to upgrading to a fixed version.\n\n## List of Announced Vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\n   DATE ANNOUNCED \n   CVE ID \n   DESCRIPTION \n   AFFECTED COMPONENT \n   VULNERABLE VERSION \n   PATCHED VERSION \n   FIX DETAILS \n   LINKS \n\n{% assign vulns = site.data.vulnerabilities.announce | sort: \"Date-Announced\" | reverse %}\n\n{% for vuln in vulns %}\n\n\n   {{vuln.DateAnnounced}} \n   {{vuln.CVE}} \n   {{vuln.Description}} \n   {{vuln.AffectedComponent}} \n   {{vuln.VulnerableVersion}} \n   {{vuln.PatchedVersion}} \n   {{vuln.FixDetails}} \n   {{vuln.Links}} \n\n\n{% endfor %}"

						"content": "{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Validating SMI Conformance with Meshery\" content=\"Meshery is SMI's \nofficial tool for validating conformance. The SMI Conformance dashboard displays the current and historical test results of each of the service mesh projects.\" %}\n\nAs service mesh providers and the surrounding ecosystem start adopting Service Mesh Interface, there is a growing need for validating the SMI implementation.\n\nAs a service mesh agnostic tool that provides lifecycle and performance management of a large number of service meshes, sample applications, service mesh patterns and WebAssembly filters, Meshery is the ideal tool for the job when it comes to SMI Conformance.\n\n## Defining Conformance\n\nConformance of SMI specifications is defined as a series of test assertions. A test assertion is a condition that must be positively verified in order for an implementation to be considered conformant. A test assertion may involve any number of conditions. Sets of test assertions are categorized by SMI specification. Collectively, these test sets comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. Just like SMI itself, the suite of SMI Conformance tests is versioned, and with each new version of SMI, as interfaces are added and specifications changed, the Conformance requirements will change as appropriate.\n\n## Validating Conformance\n\nConformance validation is performed through automated provisioning of individual service meshes, deployment of a common workload, and generation of service request load as necessary. To facilitate a common set of tests, a simple, instrumented, sample application has been developed for purposes of providing a consistent workload to apply SMI specs against. Deployment of the sample application has been fitted to each service mesh.\n\n## Capability\n\nGiven that some service mesh implementations, never intend to fully implement the SMI specifications, for each individual test, three possible capability designations exist\n\n- Full - service mesh has this capability.\n\n- Partial - service mesh has a portion of this capability implemented (may or may not have this full capability in the future).\n\n- None - currently service mesh does not have this capability (may or may not have this capability in the future).\n\n## Steps in Running Conformance Tests\n\nThe following list highlights the sequence of steps taken to perform conformance testing of one type of service mesh.\n\n* Preconditions\n   * A given service mesh’s ability to adhere to the SMI specification is validated by running a workload on top of the service mesh.\n   * Workload deployments are configured specific to the onboarding requirements of the given service mesh.\n   * Tests are defined to validate conformance for each type of SMI specification (e.g. metrics, access, traffic… ).\n* Invocation\n   * Test assertions are defined in a workload-specific way and deployed with the workloads being tested (test assertions are packaged).\n   * A test result is collected with the evaluation of each assertion. Future: Test results will be individually streamed to Meshery after each assertion is evaluated.\n   * Once all assertions are evaluated, test results are returned for visual presentation in Meshery.\n   * Tests that are run by the service mesh project team are identified by a pre-approved service account and are publicly published the SMI Conformance dashboard.\n\n\n## Reporting Conformance\n\nEach of the participating service mesh projects can leverage the [Meshery SMI Conformance GitHub action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smi-conformance-action) to incorporate SMI conformance into their CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe conformance tool will run the test suite and automatically update the conformance dashboard when the test is complete. In order to ensure provenance of test results that represent a given service mesh, each project will be asked to identify one or more GitHub accounts that will be used for publishing the tests. \n\nIdeally, this GitHub account is a service-robot account used within the project’s CI pipeline.\n\nThe [SMI Conformance dashboard](https://meshery.io/service-mesh-interface) displays the current and historical test results of each of the service mesh projects. These results are automatically updated through the projects official accounts as mentioned above."

We already have an extension point called MeshMap. \nMeshery can provide the extension point in various ways by providing the feature of custom-components. One of the example where these custom components are used is RJSF forms in meshery-extension\n\n### Extensibility: RJSF Custom Component\nRJSFWrapperComponent are the customizations done on RJSF forms overriding the default behaviour of meshery-ui rjsf forms.\nThe [Rjsf forms are wrapped](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/0bc68d1cd0ba80a565afa68bce80899c22db9a2e/ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/RJSF.js#L66) under these component to receive the custom-props from Meshery-extension.\n{% capture code_content %} \n       {\n          setData(e.formData)\n        }}\n        jsonSchema={jsonSchema}\n      />\n {% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nThese props are received in the RJSF forms like this: [RJSF Component](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/0bc68d1cd0ba80a565afa68bce80899c22db9a2e/ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/RJSF.js#L91) \n\n#### Passing new custom prop to forms:\n\n 1. Pass the new prop from the Meshery Extension in the RJSF Wrapper component used like this:\n\n{% capture code_content %} function RJSFWrapperComponent(props) {\n  // Clone the child to pass in additional props\n  const children = React.cloneElement(props.children, {\n    ...(props.children?.props || {}),\n    customComponent: YOUR_NEW_CUSTOM_COMPONENT_OR_PROP\n  });\n\n  return children\n}{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\nExtract the props in the [RJSFForm Component](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/0bc68d1cd0ba80a565afa68bce80899c22db9a2e/ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/RJSF.js#L91)\n\n_Extensibility documentation missing?_\nSubmit an issue to request more documentation.\n\n### Extension Points by File\n\n1. **/ui/components/NavigatorExtension.js** - add custom menu items in Meshery's main navigation menu.\n1. **/ui/pages/extension/[component].js** - optionally, define the state of a parent menu item: expanded or collapsed.\n1. **ui/remote-component.config.js** - list of Material UI components made available to Remote Providers and their plugins.\n1. **ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternServiceFormCore.js** - PatternServiceFormCore component which decouples the SettingsForm and TraitsForm from their UI representation while keeping the logic coupled. This design lets the Remote Provider amend the design of the components without interfering with Meshery UI's core logic.\n\n### Using React JSON Schema Form\n Meshery exposes a custom RJSF Form component which is capable of generating \"Pattern\" YAMLs without being extremely opinionated about the UI. This custom component is available at `ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternServiceFormCore.js`. An example usage of the component which will render the logically coupled `SettingsForm` and `TraitsForm` in a Material UI `TabPanel`:\n\n{% capture code_content %} \n\t{(SettingsForm, TraitsForm) => {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t);\n\t}}\n  {% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n Meshery UI's RJSF form accepts two props:\n\n- `RJSFWrapperComponent`: The wrapper component gets all of the props that are passed to the underlying form, allowing to inspect the props and changing the behaviour based on them.\n- `RJSFFormChildComponent`: This component will customize the internals of the RJSF form.\n\nWith both of these props, Remote Providers can customize the wrapper and can also customize the body of the form. This allows full customization of the form.\n\nfrom _ui/components/MesheryMeshInterface/PatternService/index.js_\n{% include code.html code=\"function PatternService({ formData, jsonSchema, onChange, type, onSubmit, onDelete, RJSFWrapperComponent, RJSFFormChildComponent })\" %}"

Meshery is comprised of a number of components including a server, adapters, UI, and CLI. As an application, Meshery is a composition of different functional components.\n\n\n\n    \nFigure: Meshery components\n\n\nSome of the components must be upgraded simultaneously, while others may be upgraded independently. The following table depicts components, their versions, and deployment units (deployment groups).\n\n### Versioning of Meshery components\n\n\n    \n        Components\n        Sub-component\n        Considering or Updating\n    \n    \n        Meshery Adapters\n        Any and All Adapters\n        Docker Deployment: Watchtower updates this component in accordance with the user’s release channel subscription.\n    \n    \n        Meshery Server\n        Meshery UI\n        Manages lifecycle of Meshery Operator; Adapters, UI, Load Generators, Database.\nDocker Deployment: Watchtower updates this component in accordance with the user’s release channel subscription.\n    \n    \n        Load Generators\n    \n    \n        Database\n    \n    \n        Meshery Operator\n        MeshSync\n        Meshery Operator manages the lifecycle of this component and its sub-components.\n    \n    \n        Meshery Broker\n        Meshery Operator manages the lifecycle of this event bus component.\n    \n    \n        `mesheryctl`\n        \n        mesheryctl manages the lifecycle of Meshery Server. \n         \n            system start calls system update by default, which updates server and existing adapters, but doesn’t update meshery.yaml. Unless the skipUpdate flag is used, operators are also updated here.\n            system reset retrieving docker-compose.yaml from GitHub (use git tag to reset to the right Meshery version).\n            system restart also updates operators, unless the skipUpdate flag is used.\n            system update updates operators in case of both docker and kubernetes deployments.\n            system context manages config.yaml, which manages meshery.yaml. \n            mesheryctl should generally be checking for latest release and informing user.\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Remote Providers\n        Meshery Cloud\n        Process Extension: Integrators manage the lifecycle of their Remote Providers.

						"title": "Using Meshery CLI",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /guides/mesheryctl/working-with-mesheryctl",
						"content": "Meshery's command line interface is `mesheryctl`. Use `mesheryctl` to both manage the lifecyle of Meshery itself and to access and invoke any of Meshery's application and cloud native management functions. `mesheryctl` commands can be categorized as follows:\n\n- `mesheryctl` - Global overrides and flags\n- `mesheryctl app` - Cloud Native Application Management\n- `mesheryctl filter` - Cloud Native Filter Management\n- `mesheryctl mesh` - Cloud Native Lifecycle & Configuration Management\n- `mesheryctl perf` - Cloud Native Performance Management\n- `mesheryctl pattern` - Cloud Native Pattern Configuration & Management\n- `mesheryctl system` - Meshery Lifecycle and Troubleshooting\n\n## Configuring Meshery Deployments with meshconfig\n\n_Meshconfig_ refers to a configuration file found at `~/.meshery/config.yaml`. Your meshconfig file must contain one or more `contexts` in order for any `mesheryctl system` command to work. Each context represents a Meshery deployment.\n\nEach of the `system` commands are used to control Meshery's lifecycle like `system start`, `stop`, `status`, `reset` and so on.\n\n## Meshery CLI FAQ\n\n#### Question: What is the meshconfig?\n\nLike kubeconfig for `kubectl`, meshconfig is the name of your `mesheryctl` config file. You can find your meshconfig file in its default location of `~/.meshery/config.yaml`. By default, `mesheryctl` will look to this location for your meshconfig. You can override the default location at anytime with the use of the global parameter, `--config `.\n\n#### Question: What is a context?\n\nA meshconfig `context` represents a single Meshery deployment. Using `context`s, you can configure different Meshery deployments with environment-specific settings and you can easily switching between your individual Meshery deployments by updating your current-context.\n\n#### Question: Why are contexts necessary?\n\nMany Meshery users have more than one Meshery deployment. Contexts allow you to deploy different versions of Meshery, update your release channel subscription settings, selectively install one or more Meshery Adapters, and so on. Contexts allow you to configure your invididual Meshery deployments.\n\n#### Question: What is `current-context`?\n\n`current-context` identifies the Meshery deployment that when any `mesheryctl` command is invoked will use the environment described in the `current-context`. You can switch between contexts. Only one context can be the `current-context`.\n\n#### Question: What's the difference between contexts and environments?\n\nContexts configure Meshery deployments (server, adapters, operator and so on), while environments define a collection of Kubernetes clusters and cloud native infrastructure under management in Meshery.\n\n#### Question: What does the default meshconfig look like?\n\nThe following template is used to create a config file from scratch. Not all of the following variables are required to be included. Some of the variables may have a null value or may be excluded (e.g. “adapters”).\n\n```\ncontexts:\n    :\n      endpoint: \n      token: \n      platform: \n      # Future: specify type of kubernetes (e.g. eks)\n      adapters: \n\n   :\n    endpoint: \n    token: \n    platform: \n    current-context: \n\ntokens:\n- name: \n  location: \n- name: \n  value: \n  # Future: allow embedding of token certificate\n```\n\nTry it out and see for yourself. Run `mesheryctl system context create test` and `mesheryctl system context view test`.\n\n#### Question: How do endpoints work in meshconfig?\n\nEndpoints specify the access URL for the Meshery UI, for a deployment. Endpoints are developed based on platform:\n\n- Docker: Docker users can specify the endpoint in the meshconfig. The port specified in this will be used to generate the endpoint. The endpoint is of the form `http://localhost:port`, where `port` is taken from the meshconfig.\n- Kubernetes: Deployments with kubernetes as the platform have an endpoint generated by service discovery using the Kubernetes API. This endpoint overwrites the endpoint specified in the meshconfig.\n\n## Advanced Installation\n\nUsers can control the specific container image and tag (version) of Meshery that they would like to run by editing their local _~/.meshery/meshery.yaml_ (a docker compose file).\nAligned with the Meshery container image, instead of leaving the implicit :stable-latest tag behind image: layer5/meshery, users will instead identify a specific image tag like so:\n\n{% capture code_content %}bash\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  meshery:\n    image: layer5/meshery:v0.5.0\n    labels:\n      - \"com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true\"{% endcapture %}\n{% include code.html code=code_content %}\n\n### Suggested Reading\n\nFor an exhaustive list of `mesheryctl` commands and syntax:\n\n- See [`mesheryctl` Command Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/mesheryctl).\n\nGuides to using Meshery's various features and components.\n\n{% capture tag %}\n\nUpgrading mesheryctl\n\n{% endcapture %}\n\n{% include suggested-reading.html diffName=\"true\" isDiffTag=\"true\" diffTag=tag %}\n\n{% include related-discussions.html tag=\"mesheryctl\" %}\n\n\n\n\n\n{% include discuss.html %}"

Be sure to reference the _actual_ repo you're contributing to e.g. \"meshery-linkerd\").\n\n\nVerify the new remote named 'upstream'\n\n`git remote -v`\n\nFetch from upstream remote\nYou'll need to fetch the upstream repo's branches and newest commits to bring them into your repository whenever you wish to update your fork with the latest upstream changes:\n\n`git fetch upstream`\n\nCheckout your master branch and merge upstream\n\nNow, checkout your master branch and merge it with the master branch of the upstream repo:\n\n`git checkout master`\n`git merge upstream/master`\n\nIf the local master branch has no unique commits, git will simply execute a fast-forward. However, if you've been making modifications to master (which, in the vast majority of circumstances, you shouldn't be - see the next section), you may run into issues. Always keep in mind the changes made upstream when doing so.\n\nYour local master branch is now up to date with everything that has been changed upstream.\nCreate a Branch (to avoid conflicts)\n\nIt's essential to create a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature or bugfix. Not only is it a standard git workflow, but it also organises and separates your modifications from the main branch, allowing you to simply submit and manage several pull requests for each task you finish.\n\nFollow the steps below to establish a new branch and begin working on it.\n\nCheck out the master branch; from which your new branch will be derived.\n\n`git checkout master`\n\nCreate a new branch (Give your branch a simple, informative name.)\n\nFor continuous integration changes use\n\n`ci/your_username/issue#`  OR\n `feature/your_username/name_of_feature`\n\nFor bugs use\n\n`bug/your_username/issue#` \n OR\n `bug/your_username/name_of_bug`\n\n\n`git branch feature/jdoe/567`\nSwitch to your new branch\n\n`git checkout feature/jdoe/567`\n```(NOTE: Use the name of the branch you created instead of 'feature/jdoe/567'.)```\n\nNow you may start hacking and make any changes you desire.🚀\n\n\nStage the Changes\n\n`git add [files-changed]`\n\n```(NOTE: This will stage all the changes you have made.)```\n\n\nCommit Changes\n\n`git commit -m \"MESSAGE\"`\n\n```(NOTE: Instead of 'MESSAGE,' include a commit message so the maintainer can see what you've done.Also make sure to get the DCO signed.)```\n\n\nCreating Pull Request on Github\n\nBefore submitting your pull request, you should clean up your branch and make it as easy as possible for the maintainer of the original repository to test, accept, and integrate your work.\n\nIf any commits to the upstream master branch have been made during the period you've been working on your changes, you'll need to rebase your development branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward with no conflict resolution work.\n\n\nFetch upstream master and merge with your repo's master branch\n\n`git fetch upstream`\n\n`git checkout master`\n\n`git merge upstream/master`\n\n\nIf there were any new commits, rebase your development branch\n\n`git checkout feature/jdoe/567`\n`git rebase master`\n\nNow, it may be desirable to squash some of your smaller commits down into a small number of larger more cohesive commits. You can do this with an interactive rebase:\n\nRebase all commits on your development branch\n\n\n`git checkout`\n`git rebase -i master`\n\n\nThis will open up a text editor where you can specify which commits to squash.\n\nReferences\nGit Reference Docs\n\ngit-rebase / Interactive Mode\n\nSubmit the Changes\nGo to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, then click the pull request button once you've committed and submitted all of your changes. Simply upload the changes to GitHub if you need to make any changes to your pull request.\n\nYour pull request will track and update changes in your development branch automatically.🌸"

						"content": "# Working by Forking\nJust head over to the GitHub page and click the \"Fork\" button. It's just that simple. Once you've done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or just head straight to the command line:\n\n## Clone your fork to your local machine\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git\n```\nKeeping Your Fork Up to Date\nWhile this isn't a necessary step, if you plan on doing anything more than just a tiny quick fix, you'll want to make sure you keep your fork up to date by tracking the original \"upstream\" repo that you forked. To do this, you'll need to add a remote:\n\n## Add 'upstream' repo to list of remotes\n```\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/layer5io/meshery.git\n``` \n(\"meshery\" is used as the example repo. Be sure to reference the _actual_ repo you're contributing to e.g. \"meshery-linkerd\").\n\n## Verify the new remote named 'upstream'\n```\ngit remote -v\n```\nWhenever you want to update your fork with the latest upstream changes, you'll need to first fetch the upstream repo's branches and latest commits to bring them into your repository:\n\n## Fetch from upstream remote\n```\ngit fetch upstream\n```\n\n## View all branches, including those from upstream\n```\ngit branch -va\n```\nNow, check out your master branch and merge the upstream repo's master branch:\n\n## Checkout your master branch and merge upstream\n```\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\n```\nIf there are no unique commits on the local master branch, git will simply perform a fast-forward. However, if you have been making changes on master (in the vast majority of cases you probably shouldn't be - see the next section, you may have to deal with conflicts. When doing so, be careful to respect the changes made upstream.\n\nNow, your local master branch is up-to-date with everything modified upstream.\n\n**Create a Branch** (doing your work)\nWhenever you begin work on a new feature or bugfix, it's important that you create a new branch. Not only is it proper git workflow, but it also keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch so that you can easily submit and manage multiple pull requests for every task you complete.\n\nTo create a new branch and start working on it, perform the following flow.\n\n## Check out the master branch - you want your new branch to come from the master\n```\ngit checkout master\n```\n\n## Create a new branch (give your branch its own simple informative name)\nFor enhancements use `feature/your_username/issue#` or `feature/your_username/name_of_feature`\n\nFor bugs use `bug/your_username/issue#` or `bug/your_username/name_of_bug`\n\n```\ngit branch feature/jdoe/567\n```\n\n## Switch to your new branch\n```\ngit checkout feature/jdoe/567\n```\nNow, go to town hacking away and making whatever changes you want to.\n\n## Submitting your changes (a Pull Request)\nBefore submitting your pull request, you might want to do a few things to clean up your branch and make it as simple as possible for the original repo's maintainer to test, accept, and merge your work.\n\nIn the time that you've been working on your changes, if any commits have been made to the upstream master branch, you will need to rebase your development branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward that won't require any conflict resolution work.\n\n## Fetch upstream master and merge with your repo's master branch\n```\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\n```\n\n## If there were any new commits, rebase your development branch\n```\ngit checkout feature/jdoe/567\ngit rebase master\n```\nNow, it may be desirable to squash some of your smaller commits down into a small number of larger more cohesive commits. You can do this with an interactive rebase:\n\n## Rebase all commits on your development branch\n```\ngit checkout\ngit rebase -i master\n```\nThis will open up a text editor where you can specify which commits to squash.\n\n## Submitting\nOnce you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it."

  "Amazon MemoryDB for Redis enables machine learning (ML) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to work with data stored in Amazon MemoryDB in real-time and without moving your data.",
  "Amazon MemoryDB provides native support for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents in addition to the data structures included in open source Redis, at no additional cost.",
  "MemoryDB stores your entire dataset in memory to deliver microsecond read latency, single-digit millisecond write latency, and high throughput. It can handle more than 13 trillion requests per day and support peaks of 160 million requests per second."

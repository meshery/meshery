- Shape: Circle
  Description: The default shape for nodes, displayed as an oval. This shape is useful for general-purpose nodes where no special distinction is required.
  CommonUsecase:
    - Representing entities in entity-relationship diagrams
    - Highlighting key concepts in mind maps
    - Nodes in flowcharts
  DependOn: Often used to differentiate from standard circular nodes.

- Shape: Round Rectangle
  Description: Similar to a rectangle but with rounded corners, providing a softer, more approachable look. This shape is often used to visually distinguish nodes from standard rectangular nodes, indicating a special status or different type of data.
  CommonUsecase:
    - Softening the appearance of process steps
    - Representing user interface elements
    - Indicating start/end points in flowcharts
  DependOn: Similar to rectangles but often used for a more aesthetic or user-friendly appearance.

- Shape: Triangle
  Description: A simple three-sided shape, often used to represent hierarchical data or directional flows. It is useful for indicating movement, direction, or hierarchical relationships within a network.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Representing directional flow or hierarchy
    - Indicating warning or caution points in a process
    - Denoting transformation or conversion steps
  DependOn: Often used in conjunction with other shapes to show direction or change.

- Shape: Heptagon
  Description: A polygon with seven straight sides and angles. This shape is less common but can be used to represent specific or unique data types that require distinction from other polygonal shapes.
  CommonUsecase:
    - Specialized nodes in complex systems
    - Representing multi-faceted concepts or entities
  DependOn: Less common, used for specific representations where standard shapes are insufficient.

- Shape: Pentagon
  Description: A five-sided polygon often used for specific classifications of data. Its unique shape helps to quickly distinguish it from other polygonal shapes.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Representing specialized nodes in complex networks
    - Indicating high-priority elements in a system
  DependOn: Less common, often used to highlight unique or important elements.

- Shape: Round Rectangle
  Description: Similar to a rectangle but with rounded corners, providing a softer, more approachable look. This shape is often used to visually distinguish nodes from standard rectangular nodes, indicating a special status or different type of data.
  CommonUsecase:
    - Softening the appearance of process steps
    - Representing user interface elements
    - Indicating start/end points in flowcharts
  DependOn: Similar to rectangles but often used for a more aesthetic or user-friendly appearance.

- Shape: Round Triangle
  Description: A triangular shape with rounded corners, providing a softer look while still indicating hierarchy or direction.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Softened directional indicators in user interfaces
    - Representing processes with smooth transitions
    - Highlighting key points in infographics
  DependOn: Often used where a standard triangle might seem too harsh or abrupt

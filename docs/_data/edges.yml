- Edge: Arrow Head
  Description: Represents general direction or flow in diagrams. In UML, it could indicate direction in an association or dependency.

- Edge: Bezier Curve Line
  Description: Used for curved relationships, which might indicate non-linear or non-direct connections. In UML, it could be used for inheritance or flow that isn't straightforward.

- Edge: Filled Circle Head
  Description: Used for aggregation in UML, where one class contains another but does not own it (e.g., a library containing books).

- Edge: Filled Diamond Head
  Description: Used for aggregation in UML, typically an empty diamond at the container end, indicating a "whole-part" relationship.

#- Edge: Filled Rectangle Head
#  Description:

- Edge: Filled Square Head
  Description: Represents composition in UML, a stronger relationship than aggregation, where the contained class cannot exist without the container (e.g., a house and its rooms).

- Edge: Filled Triangle Head
  Description: Often used for inheritance in UML, where one class is a subclass of another. It indicates the "is-a" relationship.

- Edge: Line With Circles
  Description: Often represents a weak or indirect association in UML. It can also be used for dependencies or indicating optional relationships.

- Edge: Smooth Line With Circle
  Description: Represents a smooth transition or flow between elements. It could be used in scenarios where gradual change or influence is depicted.

- Edge: Straight Line
  Description: Represents a simple association or direct relationship between two entities or classes in UML.
  SVG: "StraightLine.svg"

- Edge: Tree Line
  Description: Represents hierarchical relationships, such as a parent class with child classes, or a main system branching into subsystems.
  SVG: "TreeLine.svg"

- Edge: Wave Line
  Description: Typically used to represent asynchronous signals or connections that aren't continuous. It may also denote complex relationships or uncertain flows in certain custom diagrams.
  SVG: "WaveLine.svg"

- Edge: Zigzag Line
  Description: This is often used to represent signals with interference or noise. In system design, it can be used to indicate a disrupted or unreliable connection.

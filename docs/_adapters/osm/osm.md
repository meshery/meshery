## Lifecycle management

The {{page.name}} can install **{{page.version}}** of the {{page.mesh_name}} service mesh. Sample applications for {{page.mesh_name}} can also be installed using Meshery. Using the {{page.name}}, you may also run the complete suite of Service Mesh Interface (SMI) conformance tests to validate OSMâ€™s compliance with the SMI specification.

### Install {{ page.mesh_name }} 

Choose the Meshery Adapter for {{ page.mesh_name }}.

</a>

Click on (+) and choose the `{{page.version}}` of the {{page.mesh_name}} service mesh.

## Using Service Mesh Standards

### Complying with Service Mesh Interface (SMI)

Meshery allows you to analyze the compliance status and functional capabilities of your service mesh. This allows you to compare high-level functional differences between service meshes and verify whether your service mesh is conformant with the SMI specification.

Learn more about the SMI specification and [Meshery's conformance test suite]({{ site.baseurl }}/functionality/service-mesh-interface).
### Managing Service Mesh Performance (SMP)

### Prometheus and Grafana connections

The {{page.name}} will connect to Open Service Mesh's Prometheus and Grafana instances running in the control plane (typically found in the `osm-system` namespace). You can also connect Meshery to Prometheus and Grafana instances not running in the service mesh's control plane.

### Sample Applications

The {{ page.name }} does not support Sample Applications yet.

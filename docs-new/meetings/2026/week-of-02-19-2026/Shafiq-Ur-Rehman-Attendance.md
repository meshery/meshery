Hi everyone. My name is Shafiq Ur Rehman. I am a Software Engineering student from Pakistan and a full-stack developer with a strong background in the MERN stack, Docker, and cloud-native technologies. I have experience building scalable web applications, REST APIs, and deploying applications using modern DevOps practices.

My technical interests include DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and Artificial Intelligence. I am currently learning more about containerization, Kubernetes, and AI-powered systems, and how they integrate into real-world production environments.

I am passionate about open source and excited to contribute, learn, and collaborate on projects like Meshery and the Layer5 ecosystem. I look forward to contributing and growing with the community.

Thank you.

Hello everyone, I’m Rodan from Istanbul/Turkiye. 
I'm passionate about open source and interested in contributing to meaningful projects. And that's how I come across with Meshery and very excited to contribute!
I’m strong in DevOps, CI/CD automation, and the MERN stack.

My current area of ​​interest is developing web applications and maintaining, testing, and debugging existing ones. I also participate in various algorithm competitions. Therefore, algorithms, data structures, and calculus are of great interest to me, and I dedicate a considerable amount of time to them. For this, I regularly solve Leetcode and HackerRank algorithm problems. 

My passion is also developing Javascript/C# web applications using .NET Core MVC. To mention one of my projects that interests me, I have Backendexpress.com, a website I've been working on for 5 years, which contains over 100 applications. I'm still working on it, adding applications that are useful, solve real-life problems, or that people can enjoy and find entertaining.

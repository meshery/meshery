Hi, I'm Debashish, a 2nd-year Computer Science student from Siliguri Institute of Technology, interested in contributing to Meshery.
I have experience with Go backend development, Kubernetes, and Docker. I'm passionate about cloud-native infrastructure and DevOps, which is what drew me to Meshery. 
Currently exploring the codebase and setting up my local environment. Would appreciate any guidance on good-first-issue tasks to get started!

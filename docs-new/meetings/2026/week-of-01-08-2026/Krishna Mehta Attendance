Hi everyone 👋
I’m Krishna, a software engineering student and full-stack developer with a growing interest in cloud-native technologies, distributed systems, and open-source projects. I enjoy working across the stack using TypeScript, Node.js, and Go, and I’m actively learning about system design, DevOps practices, and CNCF tooling.

I’m excited to explore Meshery, understand its architecture, and start contributing in small but meaningful ways while learning from the community. Looking forward to collaborating with you all!

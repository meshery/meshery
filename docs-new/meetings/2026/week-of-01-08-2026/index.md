Hi! 👋

I’m Ashwani, a final-year CS undergrad and Full Stack Developer (MERN). I’m passionate about Cloud Native technologies and React.

I’ve just started contributing to Meshery and recently opened a PR to fix a Redux state serialization issue in the UI. I’m really enjoying the codebase so far!

I’m looking forward to learning from this amazing community and contributing more to the project.

Excited to be here!

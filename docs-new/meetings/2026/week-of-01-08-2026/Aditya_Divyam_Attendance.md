Hi everyone 👋
I’m Aditya Divyam (aka alronova), an undergrad at IIT Roorkee. I primarily work on backend systems using Node.js, Django REST, and Go, with hands-on experience in Docker and building systems involving LLMs, RAG, and agentic workflows. Moreover, I also have experience on technologies like React.js, Flask and Flutter/

Recently, I’ve been exploring DevOps and Kubernetes, trying to understand how real-world systems are deployed, scaled, and managed. While exploring, I discovered Meshery, and I really like its approach to vendor-neutral management and visualization of cloud-native infrastructure.

This is my first open-source journey, and I’m excited to learn by contributing, understanding the project deeply, and growing alongside the community.

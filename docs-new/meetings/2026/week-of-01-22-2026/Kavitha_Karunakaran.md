Hello,

My name is Kavitha Karunakaran. I'm a Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience in the industry and I joined Meshery to start with OSS contribution and hope to use my Golang skills wisely here. 
Currently ramping up using Contributor self-paced training series.
You can find my bio in my [github profile](https://github.com/matrixkavi) as well as stackoverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3981539/kavitha-karunakaran)

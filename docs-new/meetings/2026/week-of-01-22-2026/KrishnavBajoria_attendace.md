Hello everyone,

I’m Krishnav Bajoria, a fourth-year undergraduate in the Department of Mathematics and Computing at IIT BHU. I have prior experience in open-source development, having been a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 contributor.

I’m excited to contribute to Meshery because of my strong interest in cloud-native technologies and DevOps, and how Meshery acts as a powerful management and control layer for microservices. While I come from a solid software development background, I’m relatively new to the cloud-native ecosystem and eager to deepen my understanding by learning from the community and contributing meaningfully to the project.

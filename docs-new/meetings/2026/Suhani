 I’m Suhani. I’m currently in my 3rd year pursuing BCA from Bharatiya Vidyapeeth in New Delhi. I’ve learned the fundamentals of software development , DSA and language like c ,java through my college coursework. Recently, I’ve developed an interest in cloud-native technologies and have started contributing to Meshery, particularly around the meshrey Linkerd adapter. And really very curious to learn more about how the ecosystem works and to grow by contributing more meaningfully over time.

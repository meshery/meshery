The Meshery Adapter for Cilium Service Mesh is currently under construction (stable state), which means that the adapter is not functional and cannot be interacted with through the <a href="/installation#6-you-will-now-be-directed-to-the-meshery-ui"> Meshery UI </a>at the moment. Check back here to see updates.

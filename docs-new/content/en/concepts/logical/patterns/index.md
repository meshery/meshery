A Pattern is a templated design. Patterns promote reuse. Patterns are higher level abstractions of designs, in which a complex design is represented as a single component, promoting consistent infrastructure management practices as it hides the complexity of it's underlying design. Patterns enable you to establish best practices and propagate the use of these practices in a simple consumable single component. Once created, a pattern becomes available for use alongside other components.

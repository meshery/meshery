## Supported Platforms

Meshery deploys as a set of Docker containers to either a Docker host or a Kubernetes cluster. A given deployment of Meshery can be described as either an _in-cluster_ or an _out-of-cluster_ deployment. Meshery runs as a standalone management plane on a Docker host (_out-of-cluster_) or within a Kubernetes cluster (_in-cluster_). See the complete list of supported platforms below.

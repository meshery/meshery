I’m Utkarsh Maurya, a B.Tech Computer Science student. I have a background in full-stack web development and have worked with React and Next.js. I’ve been exploring Meshery’s docs and codebase, and I’m interested in contributing to the UI since it aligns well with my skill set. I’m also keen on getting involved in cloud-native technologies. Looking forward to learning and contributing here!

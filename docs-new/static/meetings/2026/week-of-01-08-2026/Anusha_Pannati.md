Hey I am Anusha, 
a software engineering grad with experience building full-stack web apps and contributing to open source.
I’ve mostly worked with React, Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and I’ve recently started learning Go.
I’m excited to learn how real production Go codebases are written and maintained, and I’d love to contribute and learn from the community. Looking forward to collaborating with you all!

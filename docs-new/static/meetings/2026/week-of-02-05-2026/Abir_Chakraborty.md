Hi! 
I’m Abir Chakraborty, a pre-final year CS student from Kolkata, India.
I was a part of GSoC 2025 and am passionate about open source. 
My stack focuses on docker, web technologies, and AI/ML (Python, LangChain, MCP). 
I'm excited to dive into Meshery, contribute to the project, and level up my skills!

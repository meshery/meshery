Hi everyone, I am Ruthwik.
I am currently exploring open-source contributions and am excited to get involved with Meshery.
I have good experience with JavaScript, Java, along with some experience in Go.
I'm particularly interested in distributed systems, DevOps, and platform engineering.
I’m looking to contribute consistently, learn from experienced maintainers, and deepen my understanding of cloud-native and service mesh technologies.

Hi, I’m Ragul Balajii, a student at Coimbatore Institute of Technology,
currently learning AI, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain.

I enjoy problem-solving and contributing to open-source projects.
I work with Python, C/C++, and SQL, and I’m exploring Linux and React.

Excited to be part of the Layer5 and Meshery community!

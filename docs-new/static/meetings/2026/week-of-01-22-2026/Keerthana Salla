Hi, I’m Keerthana Salla, a second-year B.Tech student at NIT Delhi. I’m interested in open-source software development and enjoy learning by working on real-world codebases and collaborating with others in the community. I’m currently focused on building strong programming fundamentals and understanding how larger projects are structured, from reading existing code to fixing issues and improving features.

I’m excited to contribute through Meshery, learn from mentors and peers, and grow as a developer by making meaningful and consistent contributions to open-source projects.

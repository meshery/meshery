# Add loader while verifying connection when registering

## Description

This PR addresses issue #10454 by adding a loading state during connection verification when registering connections in Meshery. The implementation provides real-time feedback to users during the connection verification process.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Components
- **ConnectionLoader.js**: New reusable loading component with customizable messaging
- **useConnectionLoader.js**: Custom hook for managing connection loading state and event handling
- **ConnectionRegistration.js**: Complete connection registration form with loading integration
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for components and hooks

### Backend Changes
- **connections_handlers.go**: Modified `ProcessConnectionRegistration` and `SaveConnection` handlers to emit loading state events

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Loading Feedback**: Users see immediate feedback when connection verification starts
2. **Customizable Messages**: Loading messages can be customized based on verification steps
3. **Event-driven Architecture**: Uses Meshery's existing event system for state management
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with user-friendly notifications
5. **Consistent UI**: Follows Meshery's design patterns and Material-UI guidelines

## Testing

- ✅ Loading state management
- ✅ Event handling
- ✅ Error scenarios

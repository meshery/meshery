# Abandonment of role

Any maintainer who is unresponsive or non-participatory (across the various forms of communication used by the project) for a period of two months forfeits maintainer privileges and resumes a contributor role.

While much communication is asynchronous, maintainers are required to attend a minimum of one meeting a month in order facilitate high-fidelity, synchronous communication, which is necessary for the quality collaboration, conveyance of complex topics, and real-time advancement of the project.

# Maintainer Teams

A core team of maintainers steward Meshery, however, Meshery is comprised of any number of components (adapters, operators, ...) and any number of logical areas of concern (e.g. community, governance, ...). The size of Meshery's project vision and the pace of its development, requires sub-teams to supplement the core team. Each sub-team is focused on a specific area/component e.g., adapters, docs, website, UI, CLI, and so on. To ensure global coordination and a strong, coherent vision for the project as a whole, each sub-team is led by a member of the core team.

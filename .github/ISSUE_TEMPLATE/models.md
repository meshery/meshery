### Instructions for Models

To add or update a model, follow these steps:
1. Create a Model Definition (yaml).

### Instructions for Components

While the default shape for new components is a circle, each component should be considered for its best-fit shape.
1. Review and familiarize with the available set of predefined relationship types. Refer the Cytoscape [node types](https://js.cytoscape.org/demos/node-types/) for a list of possible shapes. 
1. Propose a specific shape, best-suited to visually represent the Component. _Example - Deployment as a pentagon._
1. Proposee a specific icon, best-suited to visually represent the Component. _Example - DaemonSet as a skull icon._

### Instructions for Relationships

1. Identify the relationship and any specific constraints to be enforced between one or more specific components within the same or different models.
1. Propose a specific visual representation for the relationship. See list of visualizations on [Visualizing Relationships](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-relationships#relationship-visualizations)
1. Prospose the appropriate relationship type, using one of the predefined set of relationship types or suggest a new relationship where an existing type does not fit.
1. Create a Relationship Definition (yaml).
1. (Typically not necessary) create a policy for evaluation of the relationship (rego).
1. Review a prior pull request as an example of how to define a Relationships: https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/9880/files

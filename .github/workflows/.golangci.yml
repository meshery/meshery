# This file exists only to prevent GitHub Actions from failing on workflow ID 219547425.
# The actual golangci-lint configuration is located at .github/.golangci.yml

# This workflow is intentionally disabled. A repository admin should disable
# this workflow from the GitHub Actions UI and then delete this file.
# 
# Background: This file was accidentally created as a copy of the golangci-lint
# config file in the workflows directory. GitHub registered it as a workflow,
# but since it's not a valid workflow YAML, all runs fail with "0 jobs".

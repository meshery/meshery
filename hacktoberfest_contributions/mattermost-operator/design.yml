                                any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                exists or not.

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                    This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                    This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                          If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                          If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                          recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                  "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                  This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                  "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                  This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                  It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                  Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                  whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                  CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                  "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                  If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                  If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                  and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                  This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                  All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                    Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.

                                    tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.

                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                    to the PVC after it has been created.

                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                            provisioner.
                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.
                                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                    Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

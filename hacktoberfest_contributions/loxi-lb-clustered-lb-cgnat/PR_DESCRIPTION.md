# Title: [design] Add LoxiLB Clustered LB & CGNAT design

## What

Adds a Meshery Design for "LoxiLB Clustered LB & CGNAT", prepared for the Meshery Catalog.

## Source

- Design created in Kanvas (Meshmap) and exported using the Playground "Export" function.
- If generated from a Helm chart or other source, replace this section with the source repo/chart and version.

## How it was generated

1. Open Kanvas (playground.meshery.io or local playground)
2. Create the design using components and relationships
3. Save the design and export it (export YAML)
4. Paste the exported YAML into `design.yml` under `kanvas_export`

## Testing

- Import this design into Kanvas: Playground -> Designs -> Import (paste YAML or upload)
- Verify the component graph and relationships render as expected.

## Notes for maintainers

- Issue: meshery/meshery#15980
- Contributor: <AUTHOR_NAME>
- This is currently a placeholder; the contributor should replace the `kanvas_export` section with the exported Kanvas YAML.

    LoxiLB clustered load-balancer design with Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT).
    This design demonstrates a highly-available, horizontally-scalable
    LoxiLB deployment configured as a clustered load balancer with CGNAT
    capabilities to provide network address translation for upstream
    services. Use this design to evaluate LoxiLB in HA mode and test
    connectivity patterns for multi-tenant environments.

# Kanvas/Model payload
# Paste the exported Kanvas YAML below this marker. The Kanvas export typically
# includes `kind: Model` or similar and the component graph. Keep the original
# structure intact.

kanvas_export: |
  # Paste the exported Kanvas (Meshmap) YAML here. The export usually starts
  # with a top-level `kind:` field (for example `kind: Model`) and contains
  # component and relationship definitions. Keep the YAML indentation intact
  # when pasting. Example placeholder below â€” replace the entire block with
  # your exported content.

  - [Mohsen Houshmand](https://twitter.com/houshym): "Working with service mesh technology, I find one of the most useful tools is Meshery! I use Meshery to run POCs for our customers to help them adopt, and then, ongoing to check our mesh configuration. The most fantastic part about Meshery is it's performance management features."

  - "As we are a very modern technology company, we always want to use the cutting edge, open source technology to excel. All our microservices are modern in nature and so is their infrastructure. We are cloud agnostic and at the same time, we are fascinated by service meshes to empower us with secure, reliable, intelligent infrastructure. When we are in an Istio world, the need for managing the mesh was always been a gap. With **Meshery**, we believe we can nurture our service mesh to perform better and more efficiently."

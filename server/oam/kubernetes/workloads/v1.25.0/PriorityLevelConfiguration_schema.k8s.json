ACS must be a positive number. The server's concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares.

The request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not saturate most of the queues).

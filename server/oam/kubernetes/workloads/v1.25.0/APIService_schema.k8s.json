The primary sort is based on VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is \"kube-like\", it will sort above non \"kube-like\" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. \"Kube-like\" versions start with a \"v\", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string \"alpha\" or \"beta\" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA \u003e beta \u003e alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.","format":"int32","type":"integer"}},"required":["groupPriorityMinimum","versionPriority"],"type":"object"}},"title":"API Service","type":"object","x-kubernetes-group-version-kind":[{"group":"apiregistration.k8s.io","kind":"APIService","version":"v1"}]}

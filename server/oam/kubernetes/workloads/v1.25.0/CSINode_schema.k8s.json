{"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema","description":"CSINode holds information about all CSI drivers installed on a node. CSI drivers do not need to create the CSINode object directly. As long as they use the node-driver-registrar sidecar container, the kubelet will automatically populate the CSINode object for the CSI driver as part of kubelet plugin registration. CSINode has the same name as a node. If the object is missing, it means either there are no CSI Drivers available on the node, or the Kubelet version is low enough that it doesn't create this object. CSINode has an OwnerReference that points to the corresponding node object.","properties":{"spec":{"description":"CSINodeSpec holds information about the specification of all CSI drivers installed on a node","properties":{"drivers":{"description":"drivers is a list of information of all CSI Drivers existing on a node.

A volume that is both attached and mounted on a node is considered to be used once, not twice. The same rule applies for a unique volume that is shared among multiple pods on the same node.

This field enables Kubernetes to communicate with storage systems that do not share the same nomenclature for nodes. For example, Kubernetes may refer to a given node as \"node1\", but the storage system may refer to the same node as \"nodeA\". When Kubernetes issues a command to the storage system to attach a volume to a specific node, it can use this field to refer to the node name using the ID that the storage system will understand, e.g. \"nodeA\" instead of \"node1\". This field is required.","type":"string"},"topologyKeys":{"description":"topologyKeys is the list of keys supported by the driver. When a driver is initialized on a cluster, it provides a set of topology keys that it understands (e.g. \"company.com/zone\", \"company.com/region\"). When a driver is initialized on a node, it provides the same topology keys along with values. Kubelet will expose these topology keys as labels on its own node object. When Kubernetes does topology aware provisioning, it can use this list to determine which labels it should retrieve from the node object and pass back to the driver. It is possible for different nodes to use different topology keys. This can be empty if driver does not support topology.","items":{"type":"string"},"type":"array"}},"required":["name","nodeID"],"type":"object"},"type":"array","x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key":"name","x-kubernetes-patch-strategy":"merge"}},"required":["drivers"],"type":"object"}},"required":["spec"],"title":"CSI Node","type":"object","x-kubernetes-group-version-kind":[{"group":"storage.k8s.io","kind":"CSINode","version":"v1"}]}

Normalized user identities include a username and a list of group names.\\nIn contrast, IdentityProviders describes how to use that normalized identity in those Kubernetes clusters which\\nbelong to this FederationDomain. Each entry in IdentityProviders can be configured with arbitrary transformations\\non that normalized identity. For example, a transformation can add a prefix to all usernames to help avoid\\naccidental conflicts when multiple identity providers have different users with the same username (e.g.\\n\\\"idp1:ryan\\\" versus \\\"idp2:ryan\\\"). Each entry in IdentityProviders can also implement arbitrary authentication\\nrejection policies.

For example, a policy could\\ndisallow the authentication unless the user belongs to a specific group in the identity provider.\\n\\n\\nFor backwards compatibility with versions of Pinniped which predate support for multiple identity providers,\\nan empty IdentityProviders list will cause the FederationDomain to use all available identity providers which\\nexist in the same namespace, but also to reject all authentication requests when there is more than one identity\\nprovider currently defined.

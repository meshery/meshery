The best approach to handle performance impacts is to tweak the group query to be more performant, for example by disabling nested group search or by using a more targeted group search base. \\n If the group search query cannot be made performant and you are willing to have group memberships remain static for approximately a day, then set skipGroupRefresh to true.  This is an insecure configuration as authorization policies that are bound to group membership will not notice if a user has been removed from a particular group until their next login. \\n This is an experimental feature that may be removed or significantly altered in the future.

This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation. \\n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations MUST add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the associated GatewayClass.

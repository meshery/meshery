If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy,\\n    Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS\\n    queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is\\n    unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for\\n    that resource record set. If the health check status for all resource\\n    record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource\\n    record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.\\n\\n\\n  - Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings: You\\n    set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record set in a\\n    group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,\\n    and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with\\n    a type of A). You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic\\n    to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone. You specify\\n    a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. If the health\\n    check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record\\n    set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that\\n    it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status is unhealthy,\\n    Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record\\n    set. The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a group of\\n    non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,\\n    and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the\\n    resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.\\n\\n\\n# Geolocation Routing\\n\\n\\nFor geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route\\n53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic\\nregion. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in\\nthe United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a\\nresource record set that has * for CountryCode is *, which applies to all\\nlocations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy,\\nRoute 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until\\nit finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:\\n\\n\\n  - The United States\\n\\n\\n  - North America\\n\\n\\n  - The default resource record set\\n\\n\\n# Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name\\n\\n\\nIf your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend\\nthat you create a separate health check for each endpoint.

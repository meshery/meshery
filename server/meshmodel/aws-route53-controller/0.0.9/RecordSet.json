When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check. \\n For more information, see the following topics in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide: \\n - How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html) \\n - Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html) \\n - Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html) \\n # When to Specify HealthCheckId \\n Specifying a value for HealthCheckId is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations: \\n - Non-alias resource record sets: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly. \\n - Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings: You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A). You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone. You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set. The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets. \\n # Geolocation Routing \\n For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is *, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy: \\n - The United States \\n - North America \\n - The default resource record set \\n # Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name \\n If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com). \\n Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following: \\n - Create a health check that has the same value for FullyQualifiedDomainName as the name of a resource record set. \\n - Associate that health check with the resource record set.\",\n     \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"hostedZoneID\": {\n     \"description\": \"The ID of the hosted zone that contains the resource record sets that you want to change.\",\n     \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"hostedZoneRef\": {\n     \"description\": \"AWSResourceReferenceWrapper provides a wrapper around *AWSResourceReference type to provide more user friendly syntax for references using 'from' field Ex: APIIDRef: \\n from: name: my-api\",\n     \"properties\": {\n      \"from\": {\n       \"description\": \"AWSResourceReference provides all the values necessary to reference another k8s resource for finding the identifier(Id/ARN/Name)\",\n       \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n         \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n       },\n       \"type\": \"object\"\n      }\n     },\n     \"type\": \"object\"\n    },\n    \"multiValueAnswer\": {\n     \"description\": \"Multivalue answer resource record sets only: To route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify true for MultiValueAnswer.

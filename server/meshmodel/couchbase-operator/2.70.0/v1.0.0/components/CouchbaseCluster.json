The synchronization workflow starts\\nwith `spec.buckets.managed` being set to false, the user can manually create buckets,\\nscopes, and collections using the Couchbase UI, or other tooling.  When you wish to\\ncommit to Kubernetes resources, you must specify a unique label selector in the\\n`spec.buckets.selector` field, and this field is set to true.  The Operator will\\ncreate Kubernetes resources for you, and upon completion set the cluster's `Synchronized`\\nstatus condition. Synchronizing will not create a Kubernetes resource for the Couchbase\\nServer maintained _system scope. You may then safely set `spec.buckets.managed` to\\ntrue and the Operator will manage these resources as per usual.  To update an already\\nmanaged data topology, you must first set it to unmanaged, make any changes, and delete\\nany old resources, then follow the standard synchronization workflow.  The Operator\\ncan not, and will not, ever delete, or make modifications to resource specifications\\nthat are intended to be user managed, or managed by a life cycle management tool. These\\nactions must be instigated by an end user.

Just as in familial relationships, MeshModel `Relationships` are represented in a variety of forms very much resembling familiar ancestral lineage, including `hierarchical` relationships such as direct parent and child relationship as well as any number of layers of indirect grandparent and grandchild relationships. Peer relationships like that of `sibling`s take on different types such as `network` and `dependency`.  Each type of `Relationship` has `metadata`, `selectors` and some optional parameters.",

package relationship_evaluation_policy

# ----------- Module Alias Policy ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module is responsible for evaluating alias relationships.
# Alias relationships occur when a component serves as an alias
# to a field in another component.
# Example: A Container acts as an alias to the field `spec.containers[x]`
# in a Pod (where `x` is the index of the container in the Pod).
#
# 1. Validation of Alias Relationships:
#    - A previously approved alias relationship remains valid if:
#        - The path it aliases still exists in the parent component.
#        - The child alias component is still present.
#    - The alias relationship becomes invalid if:
#        - The child component is missing (e.g., the user deleted the container component inside the Pod).
#        - The aliased configuration in the parent is missing
#          (e.g., the user deleted the `containers` field in the Pod).
#
# 2. Identification of Alias Relationships:
#    - An alias relationship exists if fields in the component are defined as aliases in the relationship block.
#    - The alias relationship is identified by the presence of a selector where:
#        - `from` specifies the child component.
#        - `to` specifies the parent component.
#    - The `mutatorRef`/`mutatedRef` must be a single-item array,
#      where the item at index `0` points to the field in the child component that acts as an alias to the parent.
#    - Newly identified relationships have a status of **pending**.
#
# 3. Action Phase:
#    - For each pending relationship:
#        - Add the alias component to the design file (if not already present).
#        - Update the status of the relationship to **approved**.
#    - For approved relationships:
#        - No action is required.
#    - For deleted relationships:
#        - Remove the alias component from the design file.
#        - Remove the aliased configuration from the parent component.

# Module: Alias Relationship Evaluator
#
# Purpose: Manages relationships where one component references (aliases) a field in another component.
#
# Example: In Kubernetes, a Container component might alias the field `spec.containers[x]` within a Pod component, where 'x' represents the container's index in the Pod's array.
#
# Process Flow:
#
# 1. Validation
#    Valid relationships require:
#    ✓ Parent component still contains the referenced path
#    ✓ Child (alias) component still exists
#
#    Relationships become invalid when:
#    ✗ Child component is removed (e.g., Container deleted from Pod)
#    ✗ Referenced field is removed (e.g., `containers` array removed from Pod spec)
#
# 2. Identification
#    Alias relationships are detected by:
#    - Component fields marked as aliases in relationship block
#    - Selector configuration that specifies:
#      • 'from': The child (alias) component
#      • 'to': The parent component being referenced
#    - Single-item mutatorRef/mutatedRef array where index[0] points to
#      the child component field acting as the alias
#
#    Note: New relationships start with "pending" status
#
# 3. Actions
#    New  Relationships:
#    + Add alias component to design file (if missing)
#    + Update relationship status to "approved"
#
#    Approved Relationships:
#    • No action needed (maintain current state)
#
#    Deleted Relationships:
#    - Remove alias component from design file
#    - Clean up aliased configuration in parent component

# It is unlikely, that Meshery has a use case for supporting relationship.type == "child" aliases in the future.

Collections contain all documents and indexes in the system.  Collections also form the finest grain basis for role-based access control (RBAC) and cross-datacenter replication (XDCR).  In order to be considered by the Operator, every collection group must be referenced by a `CouchbaseScope` or `CouchbaseScopeGroup` resource.  Unlike the CouchbaseCollection resource, a collection group represents multiple collections, with common configuration parameters, to be expressed as a single resource, minimizing required configuration and Kubernetes API traffic.  It also forms the basis of Couchbase RBAC security boundaries.\",\n \"properties\": {\n  \"spec\": {\n   \"description\": \"Spec defines the desired state of the resource.\",\n   \"properties\": {\n    \"maxTTL\": {\n     \"description\": \"MaxTTL defines how long a document is permitted to exist for, without modification, until it is automatically deleted.

If the client specifies a higher value, then it is truncated to the maximum durability.

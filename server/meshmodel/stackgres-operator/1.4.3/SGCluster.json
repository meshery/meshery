Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\\n\\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\\n\\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \\\"canonical form\\\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\\n  a. No precision is lost\\n  b. No fractional digits will be emitted\\n  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\\n\\nExamples:\\n  1.5 will be serialized as \\\"1500m\\\"\\n  1.5Gi will be serialized as \\\"1536Mi\\\"\\n\\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\\n\\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\\n\\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.\",\n                 \"type\": \"string\"\n                },\n                \"resource\": {\n                 \"description\": \"Required: resource to select\",\n                 \"type\": \"string\"\n                }\n               },\n               \"required\": [\n                \"resource\"\n               ],\n               \"type\": \"object\"\n              },\n              \"secretKeyRef\": {\n               \"description\": \"SecretKeySelector selects a key of a Secret.\",\n               \"properties\": {\n                \"key\": {\n                 \"description\": \"The key of the secret to select from.

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\\n\\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\\n\\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \\\"canonical form\\\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\\n  a. No precision is lost\\n  b. No fractional digits will be emitted\\n  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\\n\\nExamples:\\n  1.5 will be serialized as \\\"1500m\\\"\\n  1.5Gi will be serialized as \\\"1536Mi\\\"\\n\\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\\n\\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\\n\\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.\",\n                      \"type\": \"string\"\n                     },\n                     \"resource\": {\n                      \"description\": \"Required: resource to select\",\n                      \"type\": \"string\"\n                     }\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\n                     \"resource\"\n                    ],\n                    \"type\": \"object\"\n                   }\n                  },\n                  \"required\": [\n                   \"path\"\n                  ],\n                  \"type\": \"object\"\n                 },\n                 \"type\": \"array\"\n                }\n               },\n               \"type\": \"object\"\n              },\n              \"secret\": {\n               \"description\": \"Adapts a secret into a projected volume.\\n\\nThe contents of the target Secret's Data field will be presented in a projected volume as files using the keys in the Data field as the file names.

Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby\\n  remain in a \\\"forked timeline\\\" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,\\n  but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).\\n\\n**sync**\\n\\nWhen in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all\\n  transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior\\n  per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`\\n  values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This\\n  means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System\\n  administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction\\n  loss.\\n\\nSynchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable\\n  standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When\\n  the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes\\n  back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior\\n  makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.\\n\\nWhen synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone\\n  mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will\\n  signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.\\n\\n**strict-sync**\\n\\nWhen it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict\\n  synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous\\n  standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres\\n  transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one\\n  synchronous replica comes up.\\n\\n**Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose\\n  transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge\\n  replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become\\n  visible for other backends.

The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.status.actual \\u003c= self.spec.maxDesired\\\"}\\n\\nIf the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.components['Widget'].priority \\u003c 10\\\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.values.all(value, value \\u003e= 0 \\u0026\\u0026 value \\u003c 100)\\\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.startsWith('kube')\\\"}\\n\\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.\\n\\nUnknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \\\"unknown type\\\". An \\\"unknown type\\\" is recursively defined as:\\n  - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true\\n  - An array where the items schema is of an \\\"unknown type\\\"\\n  - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \\\"unknown type\\\"\\n\\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:\\n\\t  \\\"true\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"null\\\", \\\"in\\\", \\\"as\\\", \\\"break\\\", \\\"const\\\", \\\"continue\\\", \\\"else\\\", \\\"for\\\", \\\"function\\\", \\\"if\\\",\\n\\t  \\\"import\\\", \\\"let\\\", \\\"loop\\\", \\\"package\\\", \\\"namespace\\\", \\\"return\\\".\\nExamples:\\n  - Rule accessing a property named \\\"namespace\\\": {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.__namespace__ \\u003e 0\\\"}\\n  - Rule accessing a property named \\\"x-prop\\\": {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.x__dash__prop \\u003e 0\\\"}\\n  - Rule accessing a property named \\\"redact__d\\\": {\\\"rule\\\": \\\"self.redact__underscores__d \\u003e 0\\\"}\\n\\nEquality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].

The most specific DNS zone match specified here will take precedence over other DNS zone matches, so a solver specifying sys.example.com will be selected over one specifying example.com for the domain www.sys.example.com. If multiple solvers match with the same dnsZones value, the solver with the most matching labels in matchLabels will be selected. If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier in the list will be selected.\",\n         \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n         },\n         \"type\": \"array\"\n        },\n        \"matchLabels\": {\n         \"additionalProperties\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n         },\n         \"description\": \"A label selector that is used to refine the set of certificate's that this challenge solver will apply to.\",\n         \"type\": \"object\"\n        }\n       },\n       \"type\": \"object\"\n      }\n     },\n     \"type\": \"object\"\n    },\n    \"token\": {\n     \"description\": \"The ACME challenge token for this challenge.
